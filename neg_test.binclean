  ++  Delonghi KBX1510 Cool Touch Electric Kettle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I'm an old hand with kettles, I thought I'd give this one to my spouse for our anniversary, but it was a bit of a dud. When the kettle was ready to boil the lid would fall down, steam would go everywhere. And it would often take ages to turn itself off. Looked great but...Think I'm going to get the braun instead

 ++  Braun KF600 Impressions 10 Cup Thermal Coffeemaker, Brushed Stainless Steel: Kitchen & Housewares ++  When I received this coffee maker, it worked long enough for me to run water through it to clean it out, then then heating element stopped working.  It took numerous calls to Braun, then of course I had to pack it up and ship it off.  Several weeks later it was returned to me and once again, it worked one time.  Again, it took several phone calls and I had to pack it up and send it off again.  I received a new unit that does indeed heat up, but has several other problems.  The drip shut off mechanism stopped working after a couple weeks, the permanent filter allows grounds to get into the coffee, and if one uses a paper filter, it tends to overflow the filter basket.  This is the worst coffee maker I've ever owned

 ++  Fiestaware Tangerine 996 5 Piece Flatware Set, Service for 1: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We have a full line of Fiesta dishware and thought having the matching flatware would be nice. After a year of standard use and dishwashing, about 1/3 of the flatware is unusable. The upside is that it is cheap and replaceable. But count me among those who would rather pay more for something that lasts. We are in the process of ditching the Fiesta flatware line and moving to something more robust.   PROS: Retro Stylish. Inexpensive compared to quality flatware. CONS: Very poorly made, Expensive if you need to replace 1/3 of flatware ever year

++  Global Decor Stainless Steel Tall Salt and Pepper Shaker Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The pepper lid seemed a little loose and I worried that it would fall off, dumping pepper everywhere.

++  Oster Blender Blade with Gasket: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Look, the product plainly reads "Oster Blender Blade with Gasket" and the package that was delivered is titled "Processing Unit with Sealing Ring".  The blade was in the package but there was no sealing ring/gasket to be found.  I'm sure there is the possibility that I got the one defective package off the line but what kind of quality assurance is that?!  I'm not telling anyone to buy or not buy this product but just be aware that you may have a problem.  I now need to buy a whole separate gasket which maybe costs all of $1.50 and will pay shipping of probably $3.

 ++  Deni 1640 Freshlock 11 Inch by 33 Foot Replacement Rolls, Set of 3: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This product will not work with home vacuum sealers that use a textured bag. This is a thin plastic sheet on a roll.  You have to cut, fold and seal the sides of the plastic sheet.

 ++  Sink & Tub Strainer   4 1/2"   White): Kitchen & Housewares ++  This gadget is better than nothing as a sink strainer  unlike the  miserable Sinktastic, which I find hopelessly misdesigned) but it's still far inferior to any good stainless steel mesh strainer. Do a web search for "sink mesh strainer".) This one slides around on top of the sink drain, letting gunk slide in around it. Yet it's impossible to pick up without using your ewww) fingernails. And those fingernails will be picking up a rusting metal edge, if yours grows old at all like mine did.   Well, "grows old" is overly charitable to this cheaply finished thing. I think I used mine for maybe the equivalent of 30 full kitchen hours before the paint along the edges began to chip and the underlying metal began to severely corrode.   One way this might be made reasonably useful is if you sealed it in place with a waterproof nontoxic silicone caulk so it didn't move around. Then you could scrub it right there in the sink and never deal with prying it out for cleaning etc.   Yechhh... 
December 26, 2003 ++  Kitchenaid Wire Sled With 12 Cup Muffin Pan, Silicone, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I totally agree with the previous reviewer.  This pan is terrible.  I also ended up with only tops.  I suppose you could put paper muffin cups in, but what would be the point of buying this pan then???  Also, these do not nest like a regular metal pan the sled takes up a lot of room).  DO NOT BUY THIS

++  Lello Gelato Pro 4090: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I received the gelato maker in the mail and was eady to try it out.  Got all the ingredients together and in the bowl and loaded it into the machine.  I turned on the machine as per the directions and it beeped and flashed at my just like it is supposed to do when it has been on too long and the machine is freezing up.  I was not very happy with this predicament at all

++  Cuisinart CPT 70 Classic Style Toaster: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Mine died after 6 months   half the heating elements stopped working, toasting only one side of the bread.  Took it apart   no loose or broken wires, so must have been the circuitry.  Chucked it in the garbage. While it was working, it would jam easily.  The push down handle has a flimsy metal tang that twists easily when kids or oafish adults use it).  The tang then rubs against the slot, incinerating the toast

 ++  Corelle Livingware Heirloom Bloom 20 Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am very pleased with the dishes.  Years ago I owned Corelle dishes, and am now wondering why I went the way of the heavier dishes.  They don't scratch or take up a lot of space.  I bought two sets.  I love love the colors and my table settings are so nice to look at, especially since I purchased table mats with big orange blooms to put the dishes on and celery napkins to match. It really makes for a beautiful table. I get compliments all the time.  I was also very pleased with how quickly I received the dishes    in about 3 days.  I am always happy with my purchases made through Amzon.com 
December 5,
++  Corelle Livingware Heirloom Bloom 20 Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I expected the dishes to be more substantial. The plates are very light and thin, more like melamine in feel. The colors on the dinner plates and bowls are like in the pictures seen on the internet so they are what I expected. Very disappointed with the cups  I bought two sets, and only 1 of the 8 cups had ALMOST the same color intensity as the dinner plates the others were so faded kinda like when your color cartridge in your computer is outta ink) they looked like, either rejects,or they had gone through a heavy load dishwash 100 time

++  VillaWare V5225 Crepe Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We bought this to use at events for a chocolate themed group at college, and used it several times before giving up. The cord is in the way, you need a shallow dish to pour the batter into so you can dip the crepe maker, and the crepes tend to fall off half baked. We eventually gave up   now we just put chocolate on waffles

 ++  Polder 9200 93 Deluxe 48 Inch 2 Piece Replacement Pad and Cover, Red Grid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The pad sent to me did not match the description or photo.  The neck on the pad is very narrow.  The photograph depicts a different type of ironing board than the one the cover actually fits.  I bought two of these and had to return them both as they did not fit the board.  I was stuck paying the shipping, thus penalizing me for a product that was misrepresented

++  OXO Good Grips Paring and Mini Chef Knife Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My Son, who is a Culinary graduate, purchased a set of OXO knives for me as a gift.  I know they were not inexpensive.   However, within a year, three of the six knives seperated from the grips during use.   While the grips are quite nice, the knives are dangerous to use and can cause serious injury in the kitchen.   They should be removed from the market.   In all three cases, the blades flipped upwards during slicing.   
September 20, 2002 ++  OXO Good Grips Paring and Mini Chef Knife Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Sorry to disagree with other reviewers, but my experience of the paring knife was that it's perhaps the softest metal I've ever seen used in a knife, and as a result, it's not very sharp and doesn't improve if you try sharpening it. My friend, a fellow cook who got it as a gift, doesn't like it; I hated it and would never choose to use it. There's a reason the price is so low 
January 14,
 ++  William Bounds Nutmeg Twister: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This grinder worked well for about two months before the internal spring that holds the nutmeg in place became loose. Now there is so little pressure against the nutmeg, that the blade can no longer do any grinding. In addition, the size and shape of the entire mill are awkward for my small hands.   I regret not having read the other reviews before buying this. 
November 24, 2003 ++  William Bounds Nutmeg Twister: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This product has a cute name, but it is very difficult to use.  I constantly have to take the nutmeg out and re adjust it.  Larger nutmegs do not fit in the storage area.  It's a lot of work to get a little bit of nutmeg   disappointing 
September 9,
 ++  Toastmaster TOV200 4 Slice Toaster Oven Broiler: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Received this toaster as a Christmas present in 2004.  From day one I was not very happy with it.  The knobs and temperature control are difficult to use   sometimes it would bake good, other times it would not.  About 6 months ago I noticed the numbers were rubbed off of the timer dial.  About 3 months ago the timer dial became loose and it was difficult to set the time.  Today the timer dial broke off completely.  So I got about a year and a half of poor use out of it.  So, don't purchase this product, it is not worth it.

++  Emile Henry Couleurs 1/2 Quart Oval Baking Dish, Set of 2, Cobalt: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Unfortunately, I ordered these twice and received rectangular bakers instead.  This was not Amazon's fault, but Emile Henry's for mislabling the box as oval bakers when they were not.  In fairness to Amazon, they tried to make it right but had a difficult time doing so since the contents of the box were mislabled.  Althought I would have preferred the oval bakers, I kept the rectangular ones and do like them

I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS AND I WILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THIS MATTER

I called gourmet settings and they are sending me another set but I am removing the 45 piece set from my registry.  I will use them for picnic silverware not dining roon silverware

 ++  Polder 9206 82 54" Professional 1 Piece Ironing Replacement Pad and Cover, Natural: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have tried to purchase this item since May
. Without explanation, after my order was processed and I was given a date of delivery the order was cancelled and I received a notice that the  board was not available. How strange is that?  If you call the company they tell you the item is availble through Amazon. Would really like to understand what has happened. I feel somewhat less unhappy since I read a review of this very pricey item saying it was not worth the cost.   
May 10, 2001 ++  Henckels International Eversharp Pro 3 Piece Stainless Steel Knife Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I recently got this set and the 2 piece carving set of the same series. I know I should not have expected much for this great price, but the knives do not have anywhere as good a feel as the classic line of wusthof or the henckels 4 or 5 star knives. They are very light in weight, mostly due to the handles. Much better than a target or kmart knife, and great to start, but I expect to switch mine out with 'real' knives as my budget will allow

++  KitchenAid Silicone Mini Madeleine Pan, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I baked two batches of madelines side by side, one in this pan set on a baking sheet), and another in a traditional pan with non stick coating. I brushed both pans with canola oil before using. As per the package instructions, I allowed the madelines in the silicon pan to cool completely before removing them. The madelines in the traditional pan released easily, were golden and high, and had a pronounced design. The other batch were almost soggy probably from cooling in the pan), flat, pale, and did not have the appearance of a madeline. To make matters worse, they did not release easily, and a few of them even broke as I attempted to remove them. I would not recommend this pan

 ++  Rival 64451LD C 6.5 Quart Round Slow Cooker with Bonus Little Dipper Slow Cooker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Why do manufacturers always have to change a good thing?    I had a Rival crockpot for over 12 years.  It always worked great.  The idea behind a crockpot is to cood slow and low.  My old Rival cooked at 150 degrees on the "Low" setting.    I use the old Rival all the time, and decided to get a second one so I could use them both simutaneouly and cook two recipes at the same time.  I looked at the reviews for the electronic Rival models.  Everyone said they cooked too hot.  So I finally purchased this 6.5 quart model with the simple knob control.  Well, I filled the crockpot full of 8 lb.s of chicken.  The next morning, I could smell the burning food.  I looked in the pot, and the chicken was boiling on the "Low" setting.    So, the next night I filled it full of a vegetable soup recipe.  The next morning, the soup was boiling over ... again on the "Low" setting.  The veggies were overcooked and mushy.  I measured the temperature and it was 195 degrees.  I won't buy anymore Rival products.  I only gave this 2 stars because I guess you could conceivably use it to make soup ... If you're willing to stand over it and turn it off when it starts to overboil

 ++  Cuisinart GR 4 Griddler: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Although this grill has all the design elements I wanted   easy to use, quick to clean, and very compact, it is very cheaply made.  After just 3 uses, One of the joints that adheres the top to the bottom broke.  Had I not reacted quickly, I would have been burned.  We were very fortunate that our child was kept away from ever using it.  Upon close examination, we found the weak joint to be made of some sort of brittle, composite material, NOT metal.  It's such a disappointment to see such a terrific design implemented so poorly.

June 18,
 ++  KitchenAid KSB5 5 Speed Blender, Imperial Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I honestly liked the blender a lot.  I received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen's KitchenAid appliances   range, refrigerator, dishwasher, pretty much everything other than the toaster oven.  At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid's brand and durability behind it.    I use my blender for making tomato sauce and the occasional fruit smoothie.  There is some amount of ice crushing required, but that shouldn't be an issue.  I certainly was not a weekly let alone a daily user.  So, 3 years after I got the blender, I went to turn it on and it is completely dead   no light on the on button.  Changed outlets and still nothing.  It's done.  What an incredible dissappointment.  But, it seems to me that the KitchenAid brand has really taken an awful turn since it was acquired by Whirlpool?).  First, my dishwasher broke 3 repair jobs) then my stand mixer's seals are loose.  I called customer service about trying to buy a replacement thermometer for my range and after endless re routing, I got no where.  The fridge has minor issues loose rails, pieces not refitting) and is probably the best of the lot.  I did some research.  Apparently, KitchenAid is just licensing its name out on various products.  So, realistically, there is no such thing as KitchenAid quality anymore since they don't make much of anything.  Everything is just a re branded product.  Whirlpool is going to milk the brand premium until its reputation catches up to it.  From a once KitchenAid loyalist, avoid this product   yes it's beautiful but it's not going to last.  Avoid all KitchenAid products because they really are not what they once were 
April 8, 
++  Toastmaster TCM10PW 10 Cup Automatic Coffee Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Well, I can't say that I didn't like this thing at first.  It came with a little scoopy to dig out your coffee beans and grinds.  At first it seems like a nice little unit.  I poured a pot of water into it in order to do away with any oils left over from manufacturing.  I say you should run 3 pots of water through it before use filterless of course).  After a few uses, I noticed that the carafe does spill out onto the counter if you do not pour slowly.  If you want your coffee now and have no time to pour, don't get this item.  After having this machine for 3 weeks now, and using it constantly every morning, I have finally decided that it is near total crap.  I just made a pot of coffee this morning when the machine decided it would spurt some hot air &amp; water which caused the grinds blow all over the place.  Spilling out of the top onto the carafe and drooling hot coffee and grinds all over the counter.  How nice.  If you're going to buy a cheap coffee maker, spend the extra 5 or 6 dollars and get a semi decent one.  Toastmaster should stick to toasting.  If you do decided to get this, buy some towels and a mop as well 
November 10,
 ++  Back to Basics CM300BR Cocoa Latte Hot Drink Maker, Brushed Silver: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I should have listened to the other reviews!   Point 1. This machine is not only just "noisy", it CONTINUES to be loud, intermittently! Picture this: You are sipping your hot drink while reading the newspaper, relaxed, the house quiet, when like a knife cutting the silence, a loud grinding sound flies from the kitchen, your dog starts howling & barking, you jump and relaxation is out the window! It "recycles" as long as you leave it on.  Point 2. It took me TWO cycles 20 minutes) before the stuff was hot enough for me. I like beverages to be as hot as coffee.  Point 3. Take out your best scrubber & roll up your sleeves!! For every use, you have to scrub the thick coating off the bottom of the non immersable pitcher PLUS totally take apart the spout, clean it & put it back together it has 5 parts). Hope you have time for this!  Point 4. Froth? What froth? That's froth?? Stirring my drink with a spoon makes it look like that.   Final analysis: I can make the same thing in the microwave with less cleanup 
October 30,
 ++  Back to Basics CM300BR Cocoa Latte Hot Drink Maker, Brushed Silver: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Liked the product when it was working.  I used the machine about 4 times a week for 18 months. It will mix the ingredients but does not heat up the drink any more 
August 31,
++  Steam Fast SF 465 Quick Steam Professional Garment Steamer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I should have listened when the other reviewers said to stay away from this steamer.  Now I wish I had spent the extra $60 and gotten one from Jiffy.  The box the unit arrived in was pretty beat up and did not look like it had been professionally taped.  It definitely looked like it had been returned by another customer, and lucky me, I got sloppy seconds.  I read the instructions and assembled it carefully, but the performance is just awful.  Even after letting it heat up for two minutes and then holding the trigger for 30 seconds, as the instructions indicate, it lets out a pathetic gasp of steam.  Additionally, it sprays out great gobs of water all over the clothes, and I don't mean a few spots of water like you get with any  steamer

February 28,
 ++  KitchenAid K5SSWH Heavy Duty 5 Quart Mixer, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  For fifteen years I've talked about getting a good stand mixer and my sweet husband went out and bought me this one. He bought it on sale at Cosco last Spring, then stored it until we moved back to the States from Europe and gave it to me as a housewarming gift in Nov.  I've used it a few times but the paddle and whisk don't reach the bottom of the bowl and the screw meant for adjustment will NOT tighten any further.  I can't get into the bowl at all while it is in the upward position... to scape or to add ingredients. I like to make crepes, which calls for adding sifted flour gradually over eggs while beating. It's impossible with this machine. I get a gluey mass at the bottom of the bowl, unmixed... and the batter is full of lumps.  If I want to scape the bowl, which is frequently necessary since the paddle or whisk doesn't reach all the way to the sides of the bowl) I have to stop the machine and lower the bowl each time, and even then, with the paddle or whisk attached, it's not easy to reach the sides of the bowl towards the back. You can't turn the bowl without removing it from the stand completely. You have to yank on the bowl and lift at the same time to remove it from the stand. This takes a fair amount of force to maneuver. It's impossible to remove the paddle or whisk without first letting it drop completely into the batter. The speeds are not variable enough. It seems to be either ploddingly slow or so fast that any liquid or flour flies out.  It's a monumental disappointment and I'm frustrated because it's been so long since he bought it, I can't imagine they would allow it to be returned. So, I still mix everything by hand or use my stick mixer and feel crumby about the big white doorstop taking up counter space

 ++  Danby Countertop Dishwasher   DDW396W: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Rating should be "0" but that wasn't a choice.  I ordered this item at beginning of July pending move to a place that didn't have a dishwasher.  They backordered it until August 10.  So I waited and didn't have sanitized dishes in the meantime for myself and my 12 pets.  Then, on August 9, they sent me an email saying "we can't get this item, we're cancelling the order."  I have gone 5 weeks without a dishwasher!  Now I have to go find another online store to order from.  Target may advertise the cheapest price but THEY DON'T DELIVER 
October 10,
 ++  Cuisinart SMO 56 Smooth Operator 56 Ounce Blender, Brushed Chrome: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This thing is a piece of junk! It's the only blender I've ever seen that comes with a "stir stick" to unclog the sides of the jar where the stuff all goes instead of into the blades). This should have been a clue that the thing wasn't very well designed, and it wasn't. It ALWAYS needed to be stirred when making any kind of smoothie, several times, which made the process a real pain. Also, the drain spout is a great place for food to hide and get nasty. Except for the jar it's pretty cheap plastic. But it's in the trash now because the couleing fried itself after two months. Good riddance 
September 2,
 ++  Cuisinart SMO 56 Smooth Operator 56 Ounce Blender, Brushed Chrome: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The "brushed chrome" is plastic. The spout leaks, and the motor burned out in one week. On top of that the store where I purchased it, Kitchen Kapers wouldn't let me return it saying it wasn't designed for drinks that require crushing ice. Why then do some of the recipes in the manual call for ice cubes?

 ++  Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick 8 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had received this set for my Birthday from a friend.  When we unpacked the set we noticed the 8 Quart pot was scratched on the interior.  This made the non stick aspect of the pot worthless.  I gave the pots back to my friend and he returned them to Amazon and had a new set sent out.  When we received the new set the 8 quart pot again had scratches inside the pot.  I thought I would contact Calphalon to inquire about the damage and see what they had to say.  I called the Calphalon customer service number but was on hold for so long I gave up.  In retrospect I would spend the extra money and stay away from the non stick surfaces with teflon coating which are prone to scratch easily.  If you get the Calphalon One Infused Anodized pans which you will never have to replace let alone deal with the lack of customer service.  Remember the old saying "you get what you pay for."  I don't think these non stick pans will look very good after a years worth of use.  If you do choose to buy these pans examine them when you open the box for damage

It makes good coffee but if you pour water too quickly into the left side of the reservoir you get air bubbles in the water level indicator. Told to pour on the right side...

I didn't like the coffee from the start   but I figured it would get better. Two weeks later, I dumped it for a Bunn B10 B which got good ratings here. Get the Bunn   it makes a good cup of coffee.

++  All Clad Stainless 10 Inch Nonstick Fry Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  You have the bottom of the pan clad in stainless steel...the advantage of that? You can dishwasher stainless. But you can't dishwasher nonstick! You just have the disadvantage of slower heating than you would with straight aluminum underneath.  And then you put teflon on something that costs over $100...the pan will last 50 or more years, the nonstick about five if you use it lightly and don't let some idiot put metal on it ever.  There's no indication that they will resurface your pan either...the warranty just covers defects, not use.  I think this is very wasteful economically, if not environmentally because it is a massive yet not durable product, even if you recycle it). You can get a cheaper nonstick that will serve you for the five years just fine e.g. Calphalon commercial), and better you can get this pan without the teflon and learn how to season your own cookware and make it even more nonstick than this can ever be and yet utterly indestructible, even with metal utensils.  People will only buy this for the looks. After all, they don't know how to cook anyway

++  Frieling USA Inc. Handle it Glass Bottom Springform 9 in.: Kitchen & Housewares ++  indeed, there is a glass bottom, the walls are nonstick, there are even two nice handles. The seal between the actual pan and the glass bottom leaks something terrible if you use it in a bain marie. apart from that though, it's fine

++  CorningWare Creations 8 Piece Bake and Serve Set, Denim: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought 2 sets expecting them to be as good as the other Corning products I have used for over 30 years.  1 piece cracked in half while cooking vegetable in the microwave and one piece cracked in half while baking chicken in the oven!  I wrote to the company and they have not responded

 ++  Martex Egyptian Hand Towel, French Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  These are substandard thin towels.  They are cheap.  The current price is far too much to pay, and they should be about a buck each.  They are terrible in dealing with liquid because they are so thin.  I find the pictures here deceptive...there is nothing here that you can't find in your grocery store cheaper.

++  Lodge Logic 11 1/4 Inch Pre Seasoned Grill Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this with a lot of expectations hoping to cook indoor healthy grilled meats during winter. As soon as I saw the pan I was a little disappointed with the ridges. They are deep which is good) but very thin and not thick as it appears in the product photos. So your meats will be less brown.  After rubbing it with a litlle oil before cooking I set out to make my first set of turkey burgers. Now the way I make my burgers is by adding some chopped onions, garlic, and green chillies to the ground meat. That is where the pan gave problems. The meat cooked ok but the small pieces of chopped onions, garlic, and chillies that fell out of the patties got burnt very fast and stuck to the pan making it difficult to clean. I spent about 20 mins cleaning each time.  For cooking meat that is seasoned only this pan may be ok. For me it is sitting in the closet after two tries. I did not return it because the shipping costs would have made returning it too expensive in itself.  Update 12/18/2004) I bought a Hamilton Beach 31603 Electric grill for around $20 which is tremendous. It is non stick, dish washer compatible and cooks great.

 ++  FoodSaver 1 Quart Rectangular Canister: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I got this with my food saver.   It cracked in just a few uses.   I'm not pleased with Jardian either.   I was injured and can't talk when I tried to turn in a complaint by Email.   They said I needed to get a friend or family member to call them on the phone in order to get help.   What ever happened to equal access for the handicapped?    Maybe we handicapped should take our business elsewhere

 ++  Regal 300TC King Moss 100% Cotton Pillowcases: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was not happy with this item at all.

Hope this does someone some good.BEWAR

 ++  OXO Good Grips 1049953 Smooth Edge Can Opener: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I realize I'm in the minority here, but I do not find this can opener comfortable to use.  The crank does have a "good grip", but I'm not trying to grip it, I'm trying to turn it.   I do this by putting my right thumb under the near end and pushing up, with my index finger on the far end pushing down.  The knob's shape relatively short, fat in the middle and tapering to rounded ends) makes this cumbersome and tiring.  It does open cans cleanly most of the time, but If i'm opening a large can or several cans, I reach for my old basic Swingaway which sells, incidentally, for less than half the price of this OXO)

++  Calphalon One Infused Anodized 3 Quart Saut Pan with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I received this saute pan for Xmas.  I have other Caphalon no stick) pans and was delighted, based on claimed attributes of their top of line pan.  However, my pan did not have a flat bottom which is a problem on an electric range. I returned to Caphalon and hav'nt heard a thing. I tired to claim lost but ups has proof of delivery   I would like to get a known reliable brand. I dislike poor products, am extremly disappointed with the service and total inconvience of the warranty program.

++  OXO Good Grips 21181 Jar Opener: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed.  It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble.  The opening is way too big to accomplish that so, back it went to the supermarket.  I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it doesn't, I am rating this only one star.  
July 7, 2002 ++  OXO Good Grips 8 Inch Chef Knife: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have a dead knife.  This is a dangerous knife.  As I was cutting something the handle and knife broke.  I was only cutting cheese.  This should not happen with a good knife.  I loved it until it almost caused me major damage.  So be careful with this one

++  Stainless Steel Tea Ball 2.5 in.: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am a man who loves his tea.  I drink up to a dozen cups a day, so I use my tea ball quite frequently.  My major complaint with most tea balls, and the reason I must always replace them is that eventually the clip begins to not fasten securely.  Over time this gets worse, and the tea ball becomes unusable.  There are other balls with clips that are a bit more sturdy.    I just got this tea ball in the mail a week ago, and while it is still usable, the clip is already losing its grip.  Look somewhere else for a tea ball.  
January 30, 2003 ++  Farberware Classic 12 Inch Frypan with Lid and Helper Handle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  If you like scrapping food out of the bottom of a frying pan then this is the one to buy! Adding oil or cooking sprays did not help, even bacon slices stick to this pan! I finally gave up and purchased a professional non stick frying pan and love it. This pan is going in my next garage sale

 ++  DeLonghi EC140B Espresso and Cappuccino Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought a machine similar to this one late last year   it broke after about 30 cups.  The 'tap' for the steam jammed.  I'm still waiting for the repaired machine to be returned after 3 months   yes months, not weeks.  According to DeLonghi service it will be another month before it's repaired.  I have no faith this will happen, nor that it will work for any length of time after I receive it.  Their service people, while reasonably pleasant, don't help   they know virtually nothing and seem reluctant to go beyond just answering your questions.  If you're smart, you'll go buy a coffee machine from someone else

 ++  Crisa 16 Piece Impressions Glassware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought these classes earlier today because they are attractive and inexpensive.  I placed them in the dishwasher to clean them all prior to use, and one was cracked and a small fragment of glass had broken away after the cycle was done.  I then checked Amazon's reviews, and found that this was a common experience.  They're going back to the store tomorrow.  
October 26,
++  Crisa 16 Piece Impressions Glassware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  It doesn't break, chip, or even discolor, but the base has a compound kick depression on the outside and protrusion on the inside.  This makes a very messy exit from the dishwasher and precludes removal of debris on the inside.  Why hasn't any one noticed? Where's the reviews? I own a dishwasher gee ) and this is a very irritating function having to drain the glass, dry again, and place in my cabinent geez!  Don't buy it unless you have maids and butlers.  The again don't buy it because they'll get miffed too!

++  All Clad Stainless 12 Inch Fry Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am simply amazed that anyone can be satisfied with this pan.  I bought this pan last week.  I fried bacon it on medium heat as advised by salesperson).  Bacon stuck.  Fried eggs on medium heat.  Eggs stuck.  Ok, must be my fault  try low heat.  I fried bacon on low heat.  Bacon stuck.  Fried eggs on low heat.  Eggs stuck.  Pan would not come clean with hand washing and mild soap as the instructions advise).  I promptly returned the pan and got a non stick.  My life is much better.  Do NOT be fooled by the pan's good looks.  Think its just me?  My wife's sister bought the same pan.  Her report: everything sticks.  My sister has the pan.  She hates it!  Guess what?  Everything sticks.  How can a product be so popular and perform so aweful?  You are hereby on notice.

March 5,
++  Calphalon One Infused Anodized 10 Inch Fry Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This pan is a pure junk. There are already a couple of reviews and the people recognize that this is NOT a non stick surface. This is true to the very end, I mean everything sticks like hell.   So, if it sticks, why not buy a stainless steel pan instead. All this polymer invention is complete blst !!! It doesn't do anything ! I am returning this and I'll get a 1 yr lasting nonstick calphalon from amazon.

 ++  Chef's Planet 30 Inch Nonstick Oven Liner: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I used this seemingly incredible product and accidentally left it in the oven during a self cleaning.  It completely evaporated and left teflon covering the entire interior of the oven. I had to replace the oven! It was toxic from the teflon powder.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! 
July 24,
++  Chef's Planet 30 Inch Nonstick Oven Liner: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was really excited to get the aluminum foil out of the bottom of my oven when I found this product, however, it didn't last very long.  After less than two months use in my gas oven, this liner turned white and brittle because the non stick surface had baked off!  I have never baked above 425 degrees, so the claims that it will withstand 550 degrees are outlandish.  Don't waste your money

 ++  CONAIR Deluxe Fabric Steamer GS10RH: Kitchen & Housewares ++  i have a lot of experience with steamers over the years   mine as well as others used in stores. stupid me, then, for not realizing that you get what you pay for. my jiffy steamer finally died after nine years, but it served me well. it is a machine of substance, solid parts, very stable. trust me   you don't want to scrimp when it comes to working with a device designed to produce streams of hot steam! i foolishly tried to save some money by getting the conair gs10rh, and i'm returning it immediately. the well into which the telescoping pole sits is just about 1 inch deep   not deep enough to keep the pole stable. the brackets to hold the telescoped parts extended aren't firm   any heavy jacket will make them slide. the housing itself is amazingly lightweight; i thought that was a good thing, but now i know why the jiffy steamer's housing seems like it weighs a ton   you really do want the unit to be solidly anchored. handling a steamer is a serious matter. don't take on unnecessary risk by getting an inexpensive, poorly designed, lightweight steamer like the conair. spend the extra money for the product that has been the standard bearer for years: jiffy. you won't regret it. and even though mine died after nine years, i have no regrets, and now i'll do the right thing and get another 
November 30, 2002 ++  Proctor Silex 74311 Electric Knife: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The design features for the on/off switch is a good idea if you have dry hands and are prone to dropping things.  Otherwise, the on/off switch is not good at all.  The button is hard to press down and is a trigger type switch that does not allow for the blade to be left in the on position.  You actually need to keep a lot of pressure of the switch to keep it going.  The blade was sharp for the one and only time I used it.  I took it back right after Thanksgiving

 ++  Zojirushi Mr. Bento Stainless Steel lined Lunch Jar, Silver: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was given Mr. Bento as a gift last summer. I was so excited! I bring a lunch to work every day, and I thought Mr. Bento would be the perfect solution to packing a well organized, balanced, and easy to carry lunch. You can imagine my dismay when the Mr. Bento containers leaked day after day. Anything remotely soft came out from the containers, which do not seal in a tupperware sort of way. Cute? Yes. Impress your co workers? Yes. But practical? No.

 ++  VillaWare V5785 Smoothie Bar Blender and Server, Stainless Steel: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have owned this blender for two years now and will have to replace it due to one of the plastic mixer pieces snapping off, causing it to continually leak. Unfortunately it appears that I have to buy a whole new unit instead of just the pitcher portion.  Overall, there were definitely questions of durability over the years as small pieces broke off one by one, but it did tend to blend things.   As a blender alone: It was not the most effective blender I have ever seen but neither was it the worst. It was truly mediocre through and through.   As a smoothie maker: the mechanism used for the pour spout didn't allow any chunks to pass through, and it never quite seemed to blend well enough to break up those chunks. So as a smoothie maker it was not a good choice. On the good side, the stainless does look nice... although it was a little tall 
December 27,
++  VillaWare V5785 Smoothie Bar Blender and Server, Stainless Steel: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is the worst blender I've ever used. Bought it to make smoothies, but it has a hard time grinding frozen things. It never completely chops up frozen fruit, so I always end up sucking down huge hunks of semi mushy fruit when I try to blend with this thing. Not pleasant. It's also loud and it moves a lot. Sometimes it vibrates so hard the carafe detaches slightly from the base, and when you lift the carafe to pour your drink into a glass you find a fruity puddle in the base's well. I strongly discourage anyone from ever purchasing this horrible thing

 ++  Mr. Coffee WFF 6PK MR. COFFEE Water Filter Replacement 6pk: Kitchen & Housewares ++       I have brewed coffee with and without the ridiculously expensive filters and cannot tell the difference. If there was, I still wouldn't pay this much for plastic and charcoal. What were the designers thinking ??? It is just coffee, not fine wine ! 
November 25,
++  Mr. Coffee WFF 6PK MR. COFFEE Water Filter Replacement 6pk: Kitchen & Housewares ++  After checking every store I could think of and accepting that I'd have to go online, I laughed out loud when I saw this price! What was Mr. Coffee thinking? I read the other reviews of these filters and became aware that I don't even need them! Duh, I have filtered water in our house! Thank you Mr. "Train Man." The little carbon filter sounded like a good idea, but my coffee will survive without it. At least it's not a total loss because I like the coffee maker itself. Happy brewing.

 ++  Oxo 74491 Good Grips Nylon Balloon Whisk: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am usually very pleased with Oxo products, but this one is a BIG disappointment.  I have not found it to be good for or at anything.  Wished I'd saved the five bucks 
November 11,
 ++  KitchenAid KPCM050PM Pro Line Single Carafe Coffee Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I like the solid construction but I also like strong coffee.  This machine does not "spray the entire filter basket". Instead, water dribbles out of a 2 inch diameter ring, leaving dry grounds at the end of the brew cycle. I sent the first one back.  The replacement does the same thing.  KitchenAid customer service confirms that, despite the discription on Amazon, the unit does not spray the entire filter basket.  I'm sending the replacement back also. If you love strong coffee, don't buy this machine 
October 1, 2002 ++  Calphalon Collector's Edition Stainless Steel Steak Knives, Set of 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I chose this set of knives because of the Calphalon name I love my cookware!), German steel use, and the description, "Hygienic fiberglass reinforced poly resin handle will not absorb moisture, crack, split, or chip."  I was disappointed to find that one of the sets I ordered was already showing signs of rust    even though the set was unused and delivered in a "sealed" box, all four handles had rust marks 
November 20,
 ++  Cuisinart 15 Piece Cutlery Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this set of knives 2 years ago.  I have not experienced the rust or pock marks that other reviewers have, and I have been pleased with the way my knives have stayed sharp even with a LOT of use.  The purpose for my buying this set was because of the locking feature.  I have little children at home and wanted to make the knives inaccessable to them.  Unfortunately the locking mechanism is a little too hard to open for me.  Mine gets stuck on lock and then I can't get it open without pulling on it with great force.  And when you are pulling on something full of sharp knives, that is a little uncomfortable to say the least.  I have worried more than once that the force I have had to use to open it would cause the knives to all fly out when it came free.  They never have, but it is unnerving.  I tried to contact Cuisinart about it, to no avail.  No complaints on the knives, and I love that there are extra slots in the block for expanding the set, which I have.  But don't buy the product strictly for the locking feature, it is not worth it

 ++  Vornado 530B 3 Speed Compact Air Circulator, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Bought my first Vornado years ago, and is the best fan I've ever seen. Decided to get a second one... purchased this model. First unit had bad vibration, returned it. Second unit less vibration, but very noisy. Also returned. When I compare this unit to my original Vornado, the quality of construction is noticeably much inferior. I don't know if this applies to the rest of the Vornado lineup or not.
