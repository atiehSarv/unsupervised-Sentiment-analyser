++  Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events Advance), Original Poster, 27x41: Kitchen & Housewares ++  For those of you unfamiliar with the "A Series of Unfortunate Events" books, they detail the absurdly tragic lives of the fictional Baudelaire orphans, and their struggles to overcome adversity after adversity, after adversity, ad infinitum).  Hovering in the background of their tragedies and occasional, brief glimpses of happiness, is their distant cousin, the scheming, greedy, conniving, ruthless cousin, the Count.   Given the concept of the story, this poster fits perfectly, with the orphans, standing together but otherwise alone, in the middle, with the shadow of the Count casting gloom upon them.  It is a perfect fit, as is the casting of Jim Carrey as the Count

++  Stationary Bark Control by Petsafe: Kitchen & Housewares ++  i absolutely love this product. my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard/chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence. I hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking "arguments" with my dog. all barking and fighting has ceased. all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now

 ++  Reporter WireFree Intercom System: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I purchased 3 units and they work well for us.  I have 2 units in children's bedrooms on AC power and the 3rd in the kitchen on batteries for portability.  The sound is clear and set up and use is very easy.  The best thing about these units is the VOX answer option.  I have this option turned on in the kid's room and they merely have to answer back when I talk to them first without having to push the "talk" button.  This is very handy when you are talking to a 3 yr. old that doesn't quite understand how to use this.  I attached a large, very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and I keep it on my fridge; but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary.  The only small annoying feature is every time the "talk" button is pressed, a beep occurs.  But the other features outweight that small annoyance for me

 ++  Waring DF200 Professional Deep Fryer, Brushed Stainless Steel: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've always wanted a deep fryer, and finally decided to take the plunge.  After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on this model   picked one up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% coupon.  In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for   so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn't a real concern.   I must say, overall, I am quite pleased. While I am new to frying, I found it extraordinarily easy it is pretty hot though, so be careful).  Only complaint would be that the capacity is a  little on the small side, say if you're cooking entrees for a larger family for example, you can really only fit 3 MAYBE 4) pieces of chicken at a time).  But since the chicken needs to cool down anyway, this wasn't such a major issue.  It came out nice, crispy, and golden brown   not too soggy, not too crisp   perfect.    I figure if it can handle the chicken, vegetables and smaller portions will be a piece of cake.  Although I've only fried a couple of batches, I am beyond pleased   but I'll let you know if I have any problems...  Great item so far though.

 ++  Waring DF200 Professional Deep Fryer, Brushed Stainless Steel: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Easy to use, easy to clean. Two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy. This thing is easier to clean than my old George Foreman Grill and that to me was a pain in the neck). The only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil, which I do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much I've used it and what I've cooked. If I'm doing just veggies, I keep the oil. If I do a meat or seafood, I'll change the oil right after.  Very pleased overall.

 ++  Global 8 Inch Chef's Knife: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've been a German knife snob for years.  But this 8 inch chef's knife by Japan's Global is the finest blade I've ever owned.  Period.  Maybe it's not as easy to sharpen as a Wustof or a Henckel, but then again, it holds its edge ten times longer.  I've spent ten years and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds!) of dollars collecting German steel.  Global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again

 ++  Zelco "itty bitty" Book Light, LED Edition: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have a number of booklites, different vendors, different styles, some AC adapter, some straight battery, cheap to higher prices, and this one is the best, the brightest, the one I will most often use.  It is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times.  I am careful with such items, don't expect any problems, most booklites are not meant to be manhandled

 ++  KitchenAid KFPW760OB 700 Watt 12 Cup Food Processor, Onyx Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was so thrilled when I unpacked my processor.  It is  so high quality and professional in both looks and performance.  It has so many features that I love, especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time.  The egg beater attachment is excellent also.  I am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all 
August 27,
 ++  KitchenAid KFPW760OB 700 Watt 12 Cup Food Processor, Onyx Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The KitchenAid KFPW760 is exactly as advertised. It has three nested work bowls. The inner, smallest one takes a special blade a smaller version of the standard processor blade). It's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things. Pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something. The same is true for the next one until you reach the largest, 12 cup bowl.  A number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box finally, a way to keep everything together). The unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl. It's the kind with the rotating hub two hub sizes are included, one for lemons and a larger one for oranges, etc). While it seems to work, it's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the Black & Decker, but what the heck, it's worth trying.  The motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it. At first I was disappointed that there weren't any fancy front panel switch options, but after thinking about it, you only need the provided On, Off and Pulse.  Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Would I buy it again from Amazon? Again, absolutely. The transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised

 ++  Mission Folding Bookcase &#45; Natural: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love this bookcase. My only problem with it is that the bottom right side slat of wood arrived split a bit), but it still fit together, so I kept it excuse the rhymes, please). It's amazing that despite being somewhat broken it still holds 60 books, including some big heavy hardcovers, 20 DVDs, 3 DVD box sets, 12 videotapes, and a few pictures and knicknacks. And yet it takes up hardly any space in my tiny bedroom. Best part: the ease with which you can put it together. I have MS, so being able to put furniture together by myself is a very big deal. Highly recommended

 ++  Proctor Silex K2070 1 Quart Automatic Electric Kettle, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  As a tea lover for 30 years, I have to say this electric kettle is the best one in terms of cost benefit and performance. I've used this kettle for more than 1 year and it's still working perfectly. It boils water very quickly and keeps warm for a while. A+ 
November 15,
 ++  Proctor Silex K2070 1 Quart Automatic Electric Kettle, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My only reservation is for safety sake, it would probably be better to get the version that is wireless, because when you fill this in the sink you must be very careful not to get the electrical prong that connects to the cord wet.  
November 9,
 ++  Proctor Silex K2070 1 Quart Automatic Electric Kettle, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This kettle is amazing.  It's simple    you plug it in and flip the switch a light turns on to let you know it's working).   It heats very quickly, &lt;5 minutes for a full kettle of boiling water and if you only want a cup or two for tea, it heats in about 3.    For students in dorms, you can use it for oatmeal, soup, tea.  Automatically cuts off after boiling for a minute, so no worries about fire hazards.  Great product, I use it every day.

 ++  Martex Egyptian Bath Towel, Burgundy: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love using them and when washed in fabric softener they are great.  It is a great deal.  Was kind of worried before purchase from reading some of the other reviews but after having had them a week, my whole family loves them.  They are much better than the more expensive famous designer towels that I have.  For people who are complaining about these towels, go price similar items at your local high end department stores

 ++  Churchill China Brook Blue 20 Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  When I first saw this pattern on line, I was truly impressed with the design. This pattern was exactly what I had been searching for such a long time.  However, after I received the shipment, I couldn't believe how even more beautiful these dishes were...and they compliment the wallpaper that's in my dining room!  Best purchase I have made in a very long time

 ++  Shot Glasses Tic Tac Toe: Kitchen & Housewares ++  As a mathematician, game theorist, and proud Chi Omicron Chi XOX, aka "Xocks") brother, I have always been interested in this the simplest of m,n,k games, i.e. games in which players alternate placing markers on an m x n board with each player trying to place k of his or her markers in a row.  As every game theorist knows, perfect tic tac toe play by both players results in a tie game every time, with neither player achieving victory.  The clever child will figure this out on her own, as I did at an early age, and I lost interest in playing tic tac toe before I turned five.  I never lost interest, however, in studying tic tac toe and similar games, which began my pursuit of mathematics and game theory, and partly accounts for my joining Chi Omicron Chi as a college freshman.  As part of our initiation, pledges had to play a modified form of tic tac toe with vodka filled shot glasses for markers.  Each player had five glasses, and as he placed his marker, he would empty his glass.  The loser would drink the remaining shot glasses.  Most of us knew how to play perfect games of tic tac toe, so really the point of the game, as with most fraternity games, was to see who could best hold his liquor.  I do remember one unfortunate pledge, Bob, who never figured out how to play perfect tic tac toe and nearly drank himself into catatonia.  All these thoughts came rushing, so to speak, back to me when I saw the "Shot Glasses Tic Tac Toe" available for so reasonable a price at about a dollar per component.  I have a four year old son who has yet to perfect his tic tac toe game, so I bought this set to educate him.  We play the same way I did in the Xocks fraternity house.  Of course I don't give him pure vodka in his shot glasses; he only weighs 35 lbs.  As 35 lbs represents approximately a fifth of my own weight, I dilute his vodka in a 1 to 4 dilution with orange juice.  I know what you're thinking: what happens when he loses and must finish off the remaining shot glasses, including mine?  I am nothing if not fair, so when he loses, I give him an equivalent amount of diluted vodka to however much pure vodka I have remaining in my shot glasses.  Since I, knowing how to play perfect tic tac toe, never lose to my son, the reverse problem, my having to drink his remaining shots, never occurs.  My son loses more often than not, and he usually ends up walking into walls, falling down, and later becoming violently sick.  You would think all this negative reinforcement would promote rapid and forceful mastery of tic tac toe, but his cognitive development must be lacking.  I can only surmise that the time delay between his losing tic tac toe games and the negative effects of alcohol poisoning inhibits his forming the negatively reinforcing connections.  He still loves to play, however, but his game, if anything, seems to be getting worse, almost as if he is trying to lose

 ++  Shun Classic Kitchen Shears: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is my third pair of kitchen shears.  The first was $10 and lasted a week.  I thought the second pair was just fine until my Shun shears arrived.  These cut well and are also very smooth while cutting.  They fit my hand nicely. I can really feel the difference in quality.  These can perform different functions    opening bottles, jar opener, nut cracker    one blade has a curve in it to accomodate bone.  I love that they are dishwasher safe.  I probably wouldn't have purchashed these if I were not completing a Shun set.  But now that I have them, this is what I should have been using all along 
October 4, 2001 ++  Henckels Four Star 6 Inch High Carbon Stainless Steel Utility/Sandwich Knife: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The knife is solid and very comfortable in hand, however, when I got it new, the blade is slightly bent. I expect it to be in almost Perfect condition, but it's not

++  W�sthof Classic 8 Inch Cook's Knife: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This knife is well worth the money.  It is not only sharp but it behaves in your hand begging to be tuned loose on meat vegetables, fruit you name it.  Honestly, I felt it was too much for me but as I got better accustomed to its heft, I knew it was me that did not possess the skills to wield the tool.   Do not doubt yourself, learning to use it is a joy.  Treat yourself

 ++  Old Stone 16 Inch Round Oven Pizza Stone: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I made plenty of pizzas on several types of thin metal baking pans, and the results were consistenly mediocre.  Now however, with this pizza stone, I no long find myself ordering pizza for delivery.  1 cup water or beer 2 1/2 cups flour maybe a 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour mixed in) 1 package of dry yeast 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon butter  Knead and let rise twice I used to do it by hand, but now I have a bread maker which works perfectly for this purpose on the 'dough' setting).  This makes two pizzas around 14 inches in diameter.  Either roll them out with a rolling pin, or press them into shape by hand.  The dough seems to be too elastic to "throw" it into shape   I think it's a skill that takes a long while to master.  I make pizza sauce with a can of tomato paste, some red wine and/or water, chopped parsley, chopped basil, dried oregano, chopped garlic and chopped onion.  I've also used pasta sauce prego or ragu) with acceptable results.  I almost always top with mozarella and thinly sliced mushrooms.  I use parchment baking paper under the pizza.  I slide it on and off the stone this way, without resorting to corn meal.  This works perfectly for me every time.  Heat the oven up _HOT_ 500 degrees).  It will only take 5 minutes to bake at this temperature.  When the cheese is beginning to brown around the edges, it is done.  The crust is golden brown on the bottom, with just a bit of crunch.  If I let the crust rise a bit after preparing the pizza, it will be softer and thicker.  Store bought frozen pizzas are also better when cooked on this stone.  I'm giving only 4 stars because of the price.  There must be a cheaper alternative to this stone, but I'm not complaining too much, because I've thoroughly enjoyed the pizzas it's produced 
January 27,
 ++  Old Stone 16 Inch Round Oven Pizza Stone: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had never used a pizza stone but, thought they might be fun so, I put one on my registry. I made pizza on the stone using store bought dough and got rave reviews from friends. Would definately reccomend this to a friend! Just remember to let the stone heat thoroughly before using.

December 28,
++  Jiffy Steamer J 4000 Pro Line Series Garment Steamer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I just received my Jiffy Steamer J 4000 Pro Line.  It was missing a funnel which would be no big deal if they had not printed the words "USE ENCLOSED FUNNEL" in caps every where.  I sent an email and they said they will send me one they seem to have a good customer service).  Now that we have dispensed with the whining, lets talk about the product itself.  If you need sharp lines on your pants or shirt stick with your iron, this is not for you.  However if you would like to take wrinkles out of your clothes and you don't want to bother with hanging them in the bathroom while you take a shower or taking them out of the dryer on time, this does do an amazing job.  I have also purchased a JIFFY personal hand held steamer that works fairly well and provides adequate amount of steam for most of your needs.  However if you take wrinkles out frequently and have the space go for J 4000.  You get the wrinkles out faster.  If you have a concern about startup time, you do have some control over that.  I just put enough cold water in there for a few shirts and it started steaming in 4 minutes.  If you put hot water out of the tab and reduce the amount of water you can get even quicker startup time.  Or you can put it on standby in the morning before you go to the shower and put it on steam when you are ready to use it.  Standby setting uses a thermostat to keeps the water temperature at 90C degrees close to boiling).    If you can afford it, buy one.  It would make a great re gift item if you find out that you don't like it

++  KitchenAid KSM90WH Ultra Power 300 Watt 4 1/2 Quart Stand Mixer, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++   I absolutely love my KitchenAid mixer.  I like to bake and always use my mixer.  I use it to mix cake batters and knead dough.  Cakes come out perfect every time.  The mixer is a necessity for every baker's kitchen.  It is a durable product and will last a lifetime.  The mixer is well built and well designed.  Cleanup is easy too.  Just remove the bowl and beater and wash by hand or in the dishwasher.  The mixer comes with one bowl, kneading hook, flat paddle beater and whisk type beater.  There are also many accessories available for the KitchenAid mixers.    I recommend the KitchenAid mixer for every kitchen.  The more you use it, the more you will love it.

 ++  Melitta MES2B OneOne Single Serve Coffeemaker, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a perfect machine for the office. It takes up very little space,is very simple to use, cleaning is a breeze. You can fill the water tank so that water is ready when you are for a cup of delicious coffee. I purchased this coffee maker for my husband's office and for my wallet. In his building there is a coffee shop but at $...] a cup and time away from the desk 1 half hour per cup this was an expensive habit. The Melitta paid for itself in a few days. You can't go wrong with this produc

++  Emile Henry Couleurs White Mugs, Set of 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I ordered all three colors of these mugs   red, blue and white.  The blue and white mugs have a shiny, even glaze.  The red glaze is mottled and has more of a matte finish, giving it a more rustic, country look.  The mugs are great but the three different colors look very different and really don't match each other.

 ++  SwissGold Coffee Filter, KF 2 Universal Cone: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have used this filter daily for over a year and love it. At first I tried using it in a "Mr. Coffee" style machine, but found that my coffee grind was too fine and the water would filter through too slowly and overflow if I made more than 2 cups.   Since I make coffee for one or two people usually, and don't like to leave the coffee on the hot pad, so this was okay for me.  Then I switched to single cup method using a drip filter holder that fits over the cup. I bought it along with a cup at a Starbucks about 3 years ago.  One thing that is great about the SwissGold filter is that it cleans so easily. The first time I rinsed it out I took a paper towel to the inside and it came out clean. I was very surprised. Not so with the plastic filter holder.)   The taste is great, and I haven't purchased coffee filters in 3 years. Once I tried it with a coarse grind coffee in my coffemaker, which I received as a gift, and that worked out okay, too.  Currently I am using it with my caffiene free Teeccino herbal coffees help me keep my blood pressure normal under stress), and the filter works very well with those blends.  So I highly recommend it. It pays for itself if you are looking at it from that aspect.

 ++  Black & Decker DCM7 Cup At A Time Coffeemaker, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Me being an avid coffee drinker I will have to say if you want a quick cup it does the job.  For the money its cheap and provides a quick cup but you better have good coffee I used the pods and found it to be weak at time and sometimes you need a stronger cup I think more brewing is better.  Sometimes was a bit messy water all over the place but maybe Im a bull in a china shop would recommend the item I spent more on starbucks in a week

++  Trudeau Stainless Steel Vegetable Steamer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This may sound odd, but this is the first steamer that I have ever had. So needless to say, I do not have others to compare it to. However,I find that I use it more than I thought I would! The unfolded steamer fits perfectly in the pot that I most use for vegies and the like, and when I pull out the sides the steaming tray) it fits nicely up the sides of the pot. Besides your basic steamed vegies, I find that it's perfect for warming up leftovers like rice, leaving it hot and fluffy. I like that the handle extends, so you can keep the cover on it while cooking, but you can extend the handle for easier lifting. And you can't beat the price 
November 9,
 ++  FoodSaver 3.25 Quart Designer Canister: Kitchen & Housewares ++  So I read all your reviews previous to my purchase on this AND was skeptical. There were many reviewers that complained about cracks and problems holding an air tight seal. MINE WORK PERFECTLY! They are invaluable and I'm glad I bought two of these canisters. Are you people sending the canisters through the dishwasher? If so, stop it! The intense heat will eventually crack anything made of plastic. Do you have an OLD model vacuum sealer? Maybe that's the problem   a performance issue. I have the newer stainless steel V2860 and you couldn't pry that out of my hands! I would give it 10 stars if there was such a rating.  Today, I give this product 5 stars. Like most products   only time will tell how well they will hold out in the long run 
July 9,
 ++  FoodSaver 3.25 Quart Designer Canister: Kitchen & Housewares ++  At first I thought I wouldn't be able to decide what to use this for, but right away I remembered that I just bought a six pack of onion rolls and they always seemed to have to be frozen and were just not the same later or went moldy in the fridge, so I vacuum sealed them in this and they were good to the last one with no flavor change at all.  Yummy! ;7

November 25,
++  Henckels Twingrip 4 Piece Colored Paring Knives: Kitchen & Housewares ++  At first I was turned off by the bright gaudy) colors.  However, I have learned to appreciate that these knives are color coded! They stand out in the knife drawer, and you can always find the one you are looking for.  Consequently, the right knife is used to get the job done. The knives are indestructable and durable.  We have owned ours 4 5 years and they show no unusual wear. Put them into the dishwasher!  We don't do that with another knife regretted it when we have), but these can take it. The knives are well designed for function, comfortable to handle, strong, & sharp. We love them and gave sets to our adult kids who always are commenting on how useful they are. Friends that visit and use ours comment favorably on them. These aren't showy knives for formal dining nor will they impress anyone with your classy style.  However, they do impress everyone who uses them.  And, the price is nice 
October 13, 2003 ++  Calphalon Traditional Cutlery 4 Piece Forged Steak Knife Set with Wooden Storage Tray: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have had these knives for about 6 months now and could not be happier.  They have excellent balance and feel.  A major improvement to the stamped knives that comes with the Calphalon 15 piece set.  The wood storage tray that comes with the knives is not very nice light pine with no finish), but I don't use it anyway

 ++  Remanufactured iRobot Roomba 4230 Remote Scheduler Robotic Vacuum: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Delighted to have it for my wood floors, tile and area rugs. Works great picking up cat fur and other organic and non organic detritus that collects. Does require emptying the fur catcher and cleaning the brush regularly   gosh darn! So much easier to do that than taking a broom or dust mop to the entire house. Also have to set up the virtual walls and carry it upstairs and down, when I want to change areas being cleaned. Again, gosh darn! Can't totally eliminate ALL the work, no matter how much I might like to.  Don't know what was wrong with it initially that it needed to be reconditioned, but its fine now 
October 31, 
++  Lodge Original Finish 7 Quart Dutch Oven with Iron Cover: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This Dutch Oven is a workhorse in my kitchen.  I purchased it pre seasoned because I've never had a factory seasoned piece of cast iron cookware.  Bottom line:  While the pre seasoning was a plus, it's not necessary.  Just follow the seasoning instructions that come with all the Lodge cookware, and you'll be fine.  My family has had cast iron for generations, and I won't pay the exhorbitant prices for those "upscale, professional" dutch ovens that are all the rage these days.  This Lodge oven browns spectacularly, and while the dark interior may not show the developing fond as well as a lighter one, that's not a problem if one simply uses one's nose.  We can all tell when enough is enough...     I particularly like the spikes on the lid of this oven which aren't present on the more expensive ones.  These spikes allow condensation to fall back only my roasts while they cook and I don't have to worry about a dry product.  The lid on this oven also fits the 12 inch skillet which I own, and that's a plus.  It conducts heat well and when I use it camping as an oven, breads and biscuits come out as well as at home.    Yes, it's heavy, but that's the nature of cast iron, no??  If you want something lighter that comes close to the quality of this Lodge piece, be prepared to shell out big bucks

 ++  Nissan Multi Function Can Insulator: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is the second one of these I've purchased the first was a Thermos branded one without the cover). It keeps my can of soda, etc cold throughout and adds a touch of class to keeping it on my desk. Both of these are VERY rugged and I would highly recommend over a standard foam cooler. Absolutely the most functional, effective, and classy cooler I've ever had!

Each piece is durable and good looking!  My original set was also by Sango, and I gave it away after 20 years only because my decor had changed dramactically.  Now my neighbor is enjoying my original service for 12.  I expect to enjoy my new Gold Dust set for at least, the next 20 years 
October 1, 
++  KitchenAid 3 Speed Hand Mixer   KHM3: Kitchen & Housewares ++  When we got married 7 years ago, we were given a hand mixer of another brand Sunbeam, I think) that had seven or was it nine?) speeds and lots of different attachments dough hook, wisk, etc., none of wich worked well).  I have a hard time remembering exact spefications because it died after 6 months, and I hadn't even mixed anything heavy with it!  I always mixed most of my flour into things by hand to try to spare the motor my mom had burnt through several mixers). So we went to the store, and for $30 we could get another cheap brand with many speeds and fancy gadgets several brands & models available), or we could get this Kitchenaid with one set of beaters and three speeds.  I chose this simple Kitchaid and have never been sorry. This little hand mixer takes it all  even stiff cookie dough like roll out sugar cookies.  And it mixes every last bit of the flour in.  Beaters don't clog, dough mixes up smooth. I plan on someday getting a bigger kitchenaid, but so far haven't needed it.  If you are on a budget, and need to get the most power for your penny, this is the best purchase you could possibly make

++  Braun HT500 MultiToast 2 Slice Toaster, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have owned a lot of crappy toasters and actually haven't gotten another for the past 6 years. I've resorted to pan toasting in order to avoid another bad purchase. Finally got tired of so much effort for toast and broke down and got this toaster. It's so easy to use and it even defrosts frozen bread and can warm up an already toasted slice without retoasting. Worked amazingly well to heat a cold slice of pizza but I'm sure Braun is cringing if they read this! I love the little pull out tray, you don't have to pick up the whole darn thing and hold it over the sink and beat it to death! The toast comes out very even and perfectly toasted every time. Slots are wide too so a bagel is no problem. It is fast too, so you won't miss it not being a 4 slice toaster. I think you will be pleased with this great toaster, I am 
May 31,
++  Braun HT500 MultiToast 2 Slice Toaster, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The Braun HT500 is one of the best designed toasters I have ever used. What I really like....  1. A single long & wide slot, allowing you to toast large or unusually shaped pieces of bread. I have used it to toast very thick pieces of bread, long hoagee rolls, and those huge hamberger buns that won't fit in a standard toaster slot.  2. Very clean, modern appearance.  Looks great sitting on the kitchen counter, whereas many of the other toaster models today look like ugly chrome spaceships from the 1950's.  Personally, I'm not into that kind of retro look.  3. An led light that is clearly visible when the toaster is "on", allowing you to quickly see the status of your toast from the other side of the room.  4. When the toast is done, it pops up only part way. This helps keep your toast warm prior to you extracting it. You then pull the lever up a notch higher and it raises the toast up very high, making it easy to pull out even very small pieces of bread.  5. It toasts evenly.  Of course, you would expect this.  But you'd be surprised how some very expensive toasters I've used in the past were often poor in this area.  Of all those items, the first one is by far the most important. Strangely however, few manufacturers today make a long & wide toaster any longer.  Braun is one of the few that does.  That fact combined with the great design is reason for me to give it a hearty recommendation

 ++  Waring PBB201 Professional Bar Blender, Quite White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Great blender! I use it daily to make smoothies and it never fails. Powerful motor purees frozen fruits great!! Simple  only two speeds. Easy clean up 
December 5,
++  Waring PBB201 Professional Bar Blender, Quite White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have only used this blender once, but already I love it.  I will update my review if anything changes.  No more cheapo blenders for me!  I have tried Oster really bad), and Black and Decker from Walmart a tad better, but it didn't work on frozen fruit and ice).  First, with the Waring, I made a frozen Island Oasis mix using ice, and the consistency was amazing.    Second, since I'm single, I absolutely love the small size I think it's like 24 oz or so).  Third, it's not really that loud.  I mean no louder than any other blender I've used.  Fourth, there are no cheap plastic parts!  Yay!  Only high quality parts. The jar is stainless steel. If the two top pieces are plastic or polycarbanate?), they are of very high quality.    Fifth, the blades are built into the stainless steel container, and it's a snap to clean.  Just add a cup of water, a few drops of cleaning liquid, run the blender for 30 seconds or so, rinse, dry and you're done!  Cuts my cleaning time down considerably. Moreover, there's no unscrewing and cheap plastic round things that always tear.  There is absolutely no way that you would have problems with a leaking jar.  Last, I didn't have any problems with a burning smell.  I am sticking with Waring products.  My mother has one at least 32 years old), and it still works

 ++  Taylor Oven Guide Thermometer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The temperature readings were spot on. There are multiple ways to display it, hang it from the shelves in your oven, place it on the bottom of your oven. it's very stable, doesn't fall over, mostly because of it's 4 inch length.  BUT... as with all things in the oven, this will become splattered with grease, and harder to read, and you'll want to wash it....DON'T!  any type of cleaning, be it abrasive , or chemical, such as Simple Green, will erase the temperature markings... and make it useless 
October 1,
 ++  KitchenAid KICA0WH Ice Cream Maker Attachment: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This ice cream Maker is "GREAT".  The fact that I can use an industrial motor my kitchen Aid mixer) is fantastic.  It is my belief that the ice cream maker itself is as near perfect as you can get, contrary to other reviews.  If you read the description and instructions, you will find that it is not the biggest maker on the market AND that it does EXACTLY what it says it will...IT MAKES "GREAT" ICE CREAM.

++  Lodge Logic Pre Seasoned Square Grill Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love this pan.  As for cooking: This pan does a great job on steaks, burgers, chicken, whatever. Leaves really nice grill marks. The only thing you will need to do is have a cover or splatter shield for it.  I use a 16" round cover from a much bigger pan just to avoid some of the little drops of grease spattering out on my range.  This seems to work just find for me.  As for Cleaning:  I let it cool a little after cooking and pour some water no soap!) into the bottom of the pan while it is just hot enough for the water to boil a little, and using a wooden spatula only use wood in this pan), I scrape all the fond away burnt tasty bits stuck to the pan) and pour into the sink.  I repeat this once or twice and put the pan back on the heat and wipe it down with a paper towel.  I then use some supermarket brand canola oil spray and lightly coat the inside while the pan is still warm. Takes about 2 minutes to do this.  I store this pan in my oven since it tends to have a light coat of oil on it all the time. This pan is so well worth the hand cleaning to have especially since I live in an apartment and don't have access to a grill

 ++  WMF Diadem Plus 10 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The Diadem cooking set roughly meets the WMF criteria, though there are slight imperfections on the metal and the top. The products are made im China. At first I thought something was wrong, then I looked at the WMF site and indeed they have a factury in China, so they must be genuine, however, I think Amazon should clearly state if they are made in China or Germany, I ordered another WMF kettle last week, made in Germany and I think there is a differenc

 ++  All Clad Stainless 14 Inch Open Stir Fry: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I did not find a problem with the balance, as previously mentioned by another reviewer. The only thing a potential buyer needs to be aware of is, that if they are planning on tossing their food, they had better be strong because this unit is heavy! Other than that, it proves to be very useful for large portions. It heats quickly, heats evenly, holds the heat and leaves plenty of room to stir. Yes, it does heat evenly and allows the heat to drift up the sides. The purpose of a stirfry pan is to allow heat to move the sides of the pan to allow food touching the sides of the pan to cook as well. Now keep in mind, there isnt a perfect stirfry pan out on the market if you are cooking on a traditional gas top, flat top or coil range. True frying ala Asian style is done on an open flame!

 ++  Calphalon Commercial Hard Anodized 12 Inch Everyday Pan with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is simply the best pan I own. IF you follow the directions on how to cook with this pot, you won't have a problem with sticking. It's easy to use, easy to clean, works for just about everything except maybe making pancakes   for which you would want a non stick griddle). I just love being able to use metal utensils with this pot and not having to worry about scratching it. LOVE it

April 20,
++  Le Creuset 15 3/4 Inch Oval Fish Skillet, Flame: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Le Creuset's grills, woks, and frying pans come with a textured black enamel that needs to be "Seasoned" like tradiitonal cast iron. There are instructions in the product pamphlet as to how to do this. Basically after removing the stickers using a warm water and soap soak and drying the pan, the pan is coated with a thin layer of vegetable oil with a paper towel and heated at medium heat until the oil smokes. Let the pan cool, remove the oil with a paper towel, and repeat two or three times. A surface "patina" builds up that is quite non stick. From now on the pan can be cleaned with a moist towel. In the case of burned on food, a brief soak in soapy water works well. As the pan is used the patina continues to build.  Le Creuset's omelete pans do come with silverstone non stick if you like non stick.  The textured enamel works well and is stable at higher heats than non stick coating.  I own a Le Creuset Wok, a square grill pan, and three frying pans with this textured finish and I find that they work fine after being seasoned this way. I also own a Le Creuset Omlete pan that has a good non stick coating. This pan work fine for delicate foods like egg and pancake preparations. The textured finish pans work well for grilling meats, stir fries, and other hardier preparations.  If you use good non scratch silicone or nylon tools in your Le Creuset wares and a small amout of PAM or a little oil spread with a paper towel you will have no problems.

 ++  Cuisinart Blade and Disc Holder: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a super convenient item. I don't lock it so messing with the lock is not an issue. The lock could probably be a little more user friendly. It stores everything just great. It keeps the dust off of my Cuisinart goodies. I have another three blade disc holder too. That one came with my Cuisinart. This  one is a must have. 
January 29,
 ++  Cuisinart Blade and Disc Holder: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am glad that I finally have a storage unit to hold my sharp Cuisinart Blades.  I have three little kids and the thought of them getting their little hands on them always had me worried.  The only design flaw is that it can be difficult to open and then lock back into place.  I knew this going into my purchase and decided to take the chance as the flaw was better then not having to worry about my children.  Hopefully Cuisinart is aware of the design flaw and working to fix it

 ++  Black & Decker HC3000 Handy Chopper Food Chopper: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I got this as a gift from my mother when I moved to my first apartment away from home. She already had one, and loved it.  I use mine quite frequently, and makes quick work of dicing onions and peppers for philly steaks or burgers.  My brother and father have also since purchased these units.  I have had mine going on 5 years now, not a problem with it.  great value, good gift for cooks for one or two, who do not need a huge unit to chop stuff.  
June 15,
 ++  Black & Decker HC3000 Handy Chopper Food Chopper: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My mother in law got me one of these when I started feeding my first son baby food.  Before, I would just mash up our food with a fork.  This is much easier. I've had it for three years now and it's still working great.     I use it for everything, now.  My husband doesn't like veggies, and I when I cook I usually put onion, celery, and bell pepper in everything.  Now we get the taste of my beloved vegtables, and he doesn't have to deal with the chunks.  Great product!

 ++  Factory Reconditioned Dyson DC14 Animal Upright Vacuum: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Heads and tails above my 8 year old Hoover wind tunnel bagged unit. Never did understand the 8 bucks for 3 bags. Hoover should have given the vacuum away due to always having to replace bags every week adds up to big bucks quickly).  The Dyson kicks butt... Three times the dirt is picked up every week when compared to Hoover bag replacement size of dirt removed.  Wish the Dyson had self propelled system... The house keeper wouldn't be so tired after 3 hours ;o) Handy hose and a really well thought out system.   Hands down the best unit I've ever owned. Time will tell if it holds up like the hoover unit did. Won't miss the belt replacements 2) or the bag cost on the Hoover.  Would I buy another? If it holds up like my Hoover did... You bet... Like I stated before: Kicks butt at picking up dog fur !

 ++  Breville SK500XL Ikon Stainless Steel Electric Tea Kettle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I received this tea kettle as a replacement for a Nova teakettle the former model) that I purchased in October 2005.  Part of the quality of a product is how the company stands behind it, and Breville is excellent in this area.  My former kettle developed a short in the on/off switch.  I notified the company by email, and I received an email response in 3 hours asking some questions and for more detail.  In 3 more hours, I received an email with a fed x label.  They indicated they wanted to see the product, and they would either repair or replace it.  Within a week, I had this new model as a replacement, since they no longer make the Nova.  I then received a follow up phone call from Breville to make sure I got and liked the new product, which I do.  The warranty period for the new product starts again, so it has a full one year warranty.  I also asked about the switch, since I was concerned that this could be a problem, and they assured me that this is a problem they just don't have with the applicances.  The customer service rep indicated that in 10 years, he had seen about 6 of the type of problem I had.  It seems that a customer service rep that has worked for a company for 10 years also says something about the company.  The new kettle heats quickly and to a full boil.  It also has the sharp looks where you can use for entertaining.  I am happy with the product, and very happy with the company's service

 ++  Breville SK500XL Ikon Stainless Steel Electric Tea Kettle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This electric water heater feels very solid and well built. When filled to 1.7 liters, it takes about 6 min 30 seconds to boil. The kettle automatically shuts off when it boils and makes a nice bell noise when finished. I thought this would be annoying, but it is not! Also, when switched on, there is a nice white LED lighting up the water supply making it easy to read.  My only complaint about this kettle is that it is rather loud which is why I only gave it 4 stars) when it is on. A few moments after the switch is turned on, it makes this rumbling noise for the entire duration of operation

This enormous measuring cup is great for melting in the microwave and for a homemade double boiler in any pot.  The lid is a hard plastic top with flexible sides that seal up tight so you can use it to store things in the fridge and to carry things places.  Also the cover is safe for both freezer and microwave use but not the oven) and is dishwasher safe in the top rack.  The cover has three pouring choices, a regular pour spout, a slotted spout, and a spout with seven little holes.  An extremely useful item to have in the kitchen

++  All Clad 16 Quart Stainless Stockpot: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Ok, this is obviously not the same as the traditional All Clad stockpots, if it was it would be more then triple the price of this one. It is part of the disk bottom collection, however it is still top quality stainless steel and very well made. I certainly would not consider it secondary. It is a little lighter in weight than the traditional All Clad but it is not a light weight pot by any means. It is great for sauce, soup, stew, etc. You will love it and you can't beat the price. It is very easy to clean. A+  Keep an eye out, there is always some kind of rebate or gift with most cooking purchases both on Amazon and in department and cooking stores.  I actually got this stock pot free when I purchased my All Clad Roti Pan set which also came with a rack and turkey lifters in Filene's.  I would have bought it anyway, it is an excellent stockpot and the price can't be beat.   Tip: If you should get something stuck to the stainless steel use a product called "Bar Keepers Friend" to clean it. Most supermarkets have it and Kitchen Etc. and Bed, Bath and Beyond carry it too. The container like a Comet can) is gold with blue and white writing. All Clad recommends it for cleaning stainless steel and it works like a dream and is very inexpensive.

August 1, 
++  Fiesta Tangerine 494 7 Inch Covered Butter Dish: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Fiestaware ROCKS.  A few years back, I started my Fiestaware collection. The butter dish, in turquoise, was a recent addition.  I like the vibrant colors available which allow for a cheerful, eclectic mix or a more coordinated theme. It is of the highest quality and very durable in the oven as well.  I am going to put glass doors on my cabinets to showcase my Fiestaware because not only is it practical and beautiful, they are individual pieces of art!

 ++  OXO Good Grips Box Grater: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This grater has quickly become the favorite in my kitchen. It's very solidly built, unlike the old ones I have, and the non skid base is pure genius. The grating surface is nice and sharp. I love the container that catches whatever you've grated and then stores any extras with an airtight lid. Although the container faithfully catches the grated material, there will be some spillage   from the outside of the grater   especially with cheese. One caveat: Since the container stores upside down inside the grater when not in use, you have to remember to remove it and flip it over before grating. Yup, I realized this the hard way, and boy was it a mess! Despite this, I highly recommend this kitchen essential

++  Black & Decker EK800 Slice Right Electric Knife with Slicing Guide: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This knife works nicely. The blades have remained sharp after carving roasted chicken and turkey, roast beef, and yes even cakes over the past year.  The handle wipes off cleanly after use and doesn't suffer from the  extreme electric motor vibration that so many electric knives have. The handle stays cool as well. I don't have anything bad to say about this item, it has been a true performer

 ++  Cuisinart 5 Piece Measuring Spoon Set, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a very nice set of small measuring spoons   excellent for measuring baking soda, salt, etc for recipes. They are very sturdy and much better than the inexpensive plastic products you find at the discount stores. This set also comes with 2 things not shown, a nice ring to loop these together, as well as a matching S hook to hang them up when not in use. I really like this set and would recommend this to everyone

 ++  KitchenAid KV25GOXOB Professional 5 Plus 5 Quart Stand Mixer, Onyx Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Had I known what a difference this would make with my cooking, I would have bought one a long time ago. Everything is faster, now, and everything I mix, from potatoes to icing, comes out smoother, too.  There are a variety of things you can make with this mixer, and I use mine a lot. Perhaps not every single day, but almost. I bake bread with it every few days, and I decorate cakes for parties and special occasions on the side. My mixer has never let me down. In fact, I am buying an extra bowl just for convenience, too.  Sometimes you do get a strange smell when you use it to whip something up. They even tell you in your mixer's manual to expect it and that it is normal.  I've had mine for almost a year, now, and was waiting until I had it awhile before I reviewed it. But I have yet to have any problems with it.  It's cut preparation time more than half for everything I've made with it. From cakes to meatloaf and bread. It's sturdy and somewhat heavy, which means it's not going to easily be knocked off your counter.  It does have a slow start to prevent flour from going all over. However, if you are using a lot of powdered sugar or flour to the point of it being more than half full, you will still want to use the stir speed until it's a little more settled and moist or you will end up with a mess. Not a big one, but a mess nonetheless.  It comes with a book of recipes, but I've only used a few. I've never had any issues with it handling all the cookie dough and other heavy doughs I've mixed with it, however. In fact, I've made more cookies just since getting this than I did for years before. It's just so convenient and easy that I don't mind. I mean heavy doughs, too, like monster cookies and peanut butter m&m cookies, etc.  I don't know what else to say about it. I don't think you will be disappointed in this purchase. I'm usually someone who doesn't like to spend a lot of money, but this was more than worth it, and I will be buying my daughter one someday, too

 ++  KitchenAid KV25GOXOB Professional 5 Plus 5 Quart Stand Mixer, Onyx Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great.   At this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer

++  Microplane Slider Attachement for the 35000 Grater Series: Kitchen & Housewares ++  You'll feel like crazy diving foreigner Jacques "Jacky" Cousteau when you strap on this amazing new device from Microplane. Scuba dive safely up to depths of 30cm! Marvel at the previously unimaginable variety of aquatic life present in your kitchen sink! Develop contact dermatitis as a result of prolonged exposure to washing up liquid!  Using this slider as a scuba mask may invalidate the manufacturer's warranty. Scuba diving using this Microplane Slider Attachment may not be safe. At depths "grater" than 30cm the plastic mask has been known to crack under the extreme pressure, causing soaping of the eyes and shards of plastic to perforate the skin.  A fantastic addition to the 35000 Series, you'd have to be "micro" minded, "plane" crazy or in"slide" a mental institution not to develop a "series)"ous "attachment" to this "grate" grater. "35000" marks out of 10

 ++  Hamilton Beach 62695R Power Deluxe Hand Mixer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  OK, for twenty bucks it works reasonably well.  We like the storage container to hold the attachments.  But if you're looking for a lower speed to blend ingredients like flour or pancake mix, buy something else.  The #1 speed setting is way too fast.  Anything higher than #4 will decorate your kitchen walls "at no extra charge". 
March 17,
 ++  Hamilton Beach 62695R Power Deluxe Hand Mixer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I cook for a family of 5.  I make a lot of mashed potatoes that need whipping. I have gone through my share of hand mixers.   So far I don't have any complaints about this hamilton beach model.  It is powerful enough to whip up the potatoes.  It comes with a case that fits right onto the bottom of the mixer that holds the cord and the beaters.  This is wonderful since I no longer have to search through the drawers looking for the beaters.  Over all a wonderful mixer for the money if your just looking for a normal household hand mixer 
December 17, 2002 ++  Le Creuset Jumbo Spatula Spoon, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love this spatula.  When it comes to getting the last bit of dough or sauce out of the bottom of a bowl, it's perfect.  The soft silicone head easily contours itself to the bottom of the bowl  to get every last bit.  It's also incredibly stick free.  I made fondue last night and after pouring it all into the serving dish, I wiped the cheese off the spoon with a finger, rinsed it, and it was clean!  It is also incredibly heat resistent.  My household has a lot of spatulas with burn marks all along the handle from resting on the side of a pot on the stove.  I've had this spatula for over two years and it's still burn free.  I love it

++  Simply Hard Anodized Nonstick Roaster with Flat Rack: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Cleaning up is so easy now.  The other roaster pan we used would allow the juices to bake on and it you would have to soak it, scrub it and scrape it.  I love this stuff! 
June 15, 2002 ++  KitchenAid Ice Cream Spade, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is one great tool.  I have this as well as the scoop and they are both great items.  I like the spade better since I LOVE ice cream and it makes it easier to fill the bowl quicker. The style is great and the functionality is superb.  Now that Kitchenaid is making tools and gadgets, I am finding myself getting all new sorts of items I never knew I wanted or needed.  I'm even replacing other brands of tools with Kitchenaid ones

 ++  Cuisinart CMT 200P 2 Slice Toaster: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The only reason I bought this is because I visited my sister over the Holiday Season and she had one and I liked it.   I liked it even more after I bought it.   Nice toaster!!

 ++  Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick 11 Inch Square Grill Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Its the perfect size pan and easy to clean. I've cooked Thai stayle Chicken Satay sticks and salmon on it and it makes those awesome grill lines.

 ++  Shark SV736 15.6 Volt Cordless Hand Vac with Motorized Brush and Twister Technology: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This handheld vac works great. There is awesome suction and longevity. I had two dustbusters that didn't come close so I am now a convert. Only complaint is the stand used for charging. It's not easy to push vacuum into just the right spot 
November 4,
 ++  Shark SV736 15.6 Volt Cordless Hand Vac with Motorized Brush and Twister Technology: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This vacuum is rather good. It meets or exceeds the dustbuster versions. I've got only one gripe, and that's the base. It isn't exactly easy to put on and take off.  It could also do with a bigger compartment, but that's really minor. After all, this is just for small tasks. Love the motorized sweeper attachment 
August 20,
 ++  Shark SV736 15.6 Volt Cordless Hand Vac with Motorized Brush and Twister Technology: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I HAVE USED DIFFERENT BRANDS OF DUST BUSTERS BUT THIS ONE BY FAR HAS OUT DONE THEM.

 ++  Whitney Design 80 Pocket Cotton Canvas Jewelry Organizer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have bought over 6 of these for friends and family, everyone that sees it, has to have one, we make alot of our own jewelry, so we have plenty of bracelets and earrings.

 ++  George Foreman GRP4P Next Grilleration 4 Burger Grill with Removable Plates, Platinum: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This grill is awesome! I ordered it to replace my old grill, which didn't have the removeable plates and was worn down. The removeable grills make this so easy to clean...maybe takes 5 minutes. I had looked at a couple of other contact grills from different manufacturers, and though this one was more expensive, I thought it had a better design than some of the others I looked it. Definitely recommended, don't hesitate to buy this if you're thinking about it 
July 26,
 ++  Ronco Showtime Rotisserie Platinum Edition: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this item and had it delivered about a month and a half ago.  It arrived in perfect condition with all the items it says it will come with.  It's very easy to use and extremely easy to clean.  So far I have only cooked whole chickens, chicken pieces, shishkabobs, and sausages.  If I only ever used it to just cook chicken, it's still a great price.  If you can follow simple instructions, you can't go wrong with this

++  COUNTRY CURTAINS Magnetic Rod 18" 28", White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Like many homemakers, I generally leave fixture installation to the man of the house.  My husband refused to drill into our metal doors in order to install conventional curtain rods.  I went without curtains over our kitchen doorway for years and always felt that something was missing.  These magnetic curtain rods solved that problem.  The rod holders attach magnetically without screws or bolts.  The holders have never shifted out of place and have not scuffed or scratched my door.  The curtain rods are stable enough to hold heavy canvas curtains. I installed the set in a moment's time with very little effort.  My husband was surprised and thrilled that I found a way to hang curtains without marring the metal surface of the door.

 ++  Hamilton Beach 47224 12 Cup BrewStation with Water Filter, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I saw this unit on vacation and came home and bought one.  That was several years ago.

 ++  F�ri OZITECH Diamond Fingers pro knife sharpener: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Tried this on my favorite but often dull chefs knife and after 4 6 strokes was very very sharp.  Works great as promised.  casing cheap so not sure how long that will last or if it will hamper it's operation. compact, stores well, would be great for motor home or other small kitchen.  For $29, makes me wonder what the $99 version does that Amazon also carries. knocked a star off for the cheap plastic case 
June 8,
 ++  F�ri OZITECH Diamond Fingers pro knife sharpener: Kitchen & Housewares ++  3 swipes and your knife is sharp on both sides of the edge. The sharpener folds up neatly into a little case the size of a man's wallet and is easy to store. The Handy House ships immediately..I got my package within 3 days. I love the knife sharpener, and love the service I received. Thank 
May 16,
 ++  F�ri OZITECH Diamond Fingers pro knife sharpener: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this knife sharpener because I was tired of knives that would not cut & the vender I brought it from, The Handy House, told me that it worked and I had bought things from her before on her word. And it works. My knifes are old & dull. A few swips through the sharpener blade & I had a brand new knife & the price is also good.

July 7,

++  Le Creuset 2 1/4 Quart Pumpkin Casserole, Flame: Kitchen & Housewares ++  this is my first Le Creuset casserole. When I first received it, it was smaller than i was expecting. But after cooking with it couple times, I really fall in love with it! Now I always clean it after using, and have it on my stove top in the kitchen! it's so cute and fun 
December 8, 2003 ++  FoodSaver Continuous Roll Bag Material, 8 Inch by 22 Foot 2 Rolls): Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is probably the most used tool in my kitchen. The cost of the machine and bag material are more than repaid in food savings. I like the rolls as opposed to the bags because I can make the size I need without waste. Watch for sales on meat or fish; buy large quantities at reduced cost, and cut your bags to a portion size, vacuum and seal, and freeze. I have taken hamburger, steaks, fish, pork, and chicken out of the freezer after being stored for two years or longer, and they are as fresh as the day I put them in 
November 12, 
++  Chicago Metallic Gourmetware Non Stick Checkerboard Cake Pan Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I got this pan set a few years ago.  I love making checkerboard cakes  they are so simple with this set.  You can use boxed mixes, but I find the thicker consistency of the sample recipe makes a more distinct checkerboard design.    My favourite variation is to make blue and pink for baby showers instead of brown and white. I make the white cake and just use  food colouring).  
August 12,
++  Littermaid LMR300 Receptacles, 18 Pack: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Jeez, everyone, yea, they cost a buck each, ok, a buck! but they can be reused, how often do you go to the dollar store and spend a buck on a  totally usless piece of something that breaks as soon as you bring it home, hmmm? or you buy a pack of paper plates and they are gone in a couple of weeks?? Well, at least these are serving a purpose, and are reusable....I don't have to scoop anymore, and I have 2 cats, I change it maybe every 3rd day, and it's not a chore, takes less than a minute, less time than scooping and smelling it as it sits there,  and speaking of, I do not smell their poop at all till it's changed. so I'm happy and I think it's more than worth it! 
July 25,

November 2,
 ++  Oster 6646 Osterizer 12 Speed Blender with Glass Jar and Food Processor, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My old blender went kaput it was a kenmore. We decided to buy this blender since it also had a small food processor.  The food processor has become our most frequently used tool. Preparing salsa, omlettes, indian food which requires vegetables chopped into small pieces, pancakes and numerous other tasks have become so easy that we make more vegetarian dishes now and they taste better since the pieces are well and evenly chopped. Really enjoyed the blender during the summer months when we made fresh juices etc. Unlike the old kenmore one this one blends much better.  I recommend this to any one who does not want to spend money on an expensive food processor or does not have the counter space in the kitchen for all the apparatus that comes with a big food processor.

 ++  OXO Good Grips Serrated Peeler: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a jewel. Takes the skin off nice and clean. Just the tool to get rid of those tough skins on a few tomatoes and no more fuzzy peaches. Just bought 6 more for family and friends. 
September 23, 
++  KitchenAid RVSA Slicer/Shredder Attachment for Stand Mixers: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a great shredder.  Absolutly the best out there.  It is a lousy slicer.  Take the bad with the good I guess.  My wife and I shred lots of cheese because pre shredded cheese has chemicals added that change the taste and chemical properties of the cheese.   This attachment works wonderfully for cheese.     A note on disassembly.  Some people have difficulty getting the cone off the plug if you own one you know what I'm talking about).   The very easy way to remedy this is to remove the cone from the plug before removing the plug from the machine.  If you follow this one rule you will have very easy setup and take down.     
January 2,
++  R�sle Right Handed Swivel Peeler: Kitchen & Housewares ++  First, the good stuff: this peeler is sharp, requires little effort in peeling away even the toughest skins and seems quite durable. I like having it, but I'm also holding on to my cheap little Oxo peeler for a couple of reasons: first, the Rosle produces very thick peels, which is a bit wasteful. Second, I tend to be a switch hitter in terms of peeling direction and really like having a peeler that can either peel toward me or away from me. The Rosle peels in only one direction and thus sells both a right handed and left handed peeler. That said, I do appreciate its sold stainless steel construction, which will resist rust for many more years than lesser models 
August 20,
 ++  Le Creuset 6 3/4 Quart Oval French Oven, Flame: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products. These cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once. For this reason, one pan may look like another, but each is unique in its own way.   Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat. Due to this efficiency, it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat.  Over heating may cause foods to stick to the pan, or worse burn and can cause the enamel to appear stained.  Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This helps your food stay warm while serving. The opposite holds true as well, chill the pan and it will retain its chill for a surprisingly long time.  Beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials.   Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit contact to heat resistant plastic or wood utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain.   The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the French oven, Cocotte or as it's also referred to, the Dutch oven specifically.  French ovens have been manufactured by Le Creuset for over 75 years, and were developed well before then.  In all this time the design has stayed constant, affirming the relevance of its cooking qualities.  These ovens come in either oval or round shapes.  The oval shape works well for roasting whole chickens and porkloin roasts, otherwise the differences are minimal.  This pan holds 6 3/4 quarts of food, measures 9 1/2 x 12 inches or 24 x 30 cm internal diameter, 4 3/4 inch or 11 1/2 cm deep, and weighs 13 pounds.  The domed lid provides a tight seal, trapping in moisture to roll back into the dish.  The lid may alternatively be used as a holding plate for chopped vegetables or meat during initial preparations.  Be sure to lift the pan off of cooking surfaces to reduce damaging either the pan or the surface.  French oven tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot.    French ovens were developed for slow cooking by stewing, braising or boiling.  Some typical dishes include roasts, and stews.  Other possibilities include gumbos, chili, dirty rice, baked beans, Swedish meatballs, osso bucco, or curing ice cream to name a few.  One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to the old cast iron pans past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of.   PROS:  Efficient absorption and distribution of heat  Hygienic enamel cooking surface  Does not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors  Cleans easily when not abused or misused  Can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table  Easily lasts a lifetime   CONS:  Its heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 13 pound 
February 26,
 ++  Le Creuset 6 3/4 Quart Oval French Oven, Flame: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This pot rocks.  You'll fall in love with it the first time you cook with it.  It browns well, cleans easily, and goes from the stove to the oven to the table in style.   My only complaint is that mine arrived slightly chipped, but the chips don't seem to affect its performance, so I didn't send it back 
November 7,
 ++  MIU France Stainless Steel Tomato/Vegetable Mill: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This product is great for making mashed potatoes.  I love it, it is well made and sturdy.  My kids like to turn the handle and I do not have to worry about any electric blades cutting their fingers.  The price is very good for this item. I prefer non electric kitchen gadgets, to save space) and this one is great.

 ++  Moving Men 8 Piece Furniture Slider Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I used the four large slider discs to move an 8' x 10' gambrel roofed framed shed a few feet on a cement pad after building the mini barn & painting it).  The move placed it against the fence.  It wasn't easy, but they did the job and......the slider discs are still useable though scratched up

August 30,
 ++  Le Creuset 14 1/4 Inch Cast Iron Wok with Glass Lid, Flame: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Le Creuset made a decent effort in making a cast iron Chinese styled wok.  It looks like a Chinese wok, and it is made of iron, but essentially it is not Chinese.  The wok is much thicker than a Chinese iron wok, and therefore takes much longer time to warm up. Some American users praised the wok by saying it does not need much fire, yet the essence of Chinese stir frying is cooking through large fire: one heats a thin Chinese carbon iron wok with large fire, puts in vegetable or animal oil, and then does the entire stir frying in less than a few minutes.  Still, I liked the wok after purchasing it. The Chinese food here in the US usually is not really Chinese food in essence, but people like it. Why should I be so critial to a French cast iron wok which looks like a Chinese wok?  
March 12,
 ++  Calphalon One Infused Anodized 9 Inch Chef's Skillet with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've stir fried in this pan quite a few meals, including carmelizing onions with soy sauce. When used with medium heat, cleaning is very easy. Soaking it for a few minutes and then scrubbing with scotch bright for a minute works. I've done this also with high heat, it needed more scrubbing but after a few minutes it looked new.   If you don't mind the extra scrubbing, as I don't, you'll be happy with a healthier alternative to non stick pans. My experience shows that with a few minutes of scrubbing the advantages of nonstick can be matched even in the worst case scenario.  I'm a bit ambivalent about the size. I cook for myself and thought 9" would suffice, but I didn't take into account the fact that I cook for 2 3 days at a time. This pan is a bit too small in that capacity. On the other hand, my stove top is tiny so it fits fine.  The handle is beautiful and well designed. I have no problem holding the pan even when full in one hand and it's well insulated. In contrast, I also own the Simply Calphalon sauce pan with a handle that's barely suitable for the weight. The quality of this pan is evident.  All in all, a very high quality product that will serve me for years 
November 5,
 ++  MIU France Bamboo Serving Board, Large: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Regarding the "glue" issue.  The cutting board came to me as described in Lisa Dryer's review below:  shrink wrapped in plastic.  However, the product's label was adhered to the surface of the cutting board with a big glob of what appears to be that clear sticky stuff they use to hold inserts in magazines, etc. .....and it adheres to bamboo, for sure.  I managed to get most of it off, but a thin layer remains.  I figure that "Goof Off" or some other solvent would get rid of it, but I don't want to put poison on something that'll be holding my food.  One solution is to use only one side of the cutting board.    Otherwise, it appears to be a perfectly fine product 
September 30,
 ++  Pyrex Storage Deluxe 8 Piece Set with Lids, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We have been using these for several years now.  For refrigerator storage and reheating, we use these containers almost daily.  I remember the lids were a bit stiff at first, but not impossible unless you are over 80.  After 5 or 6 times through the dishwasher, they were prefect and remain so.  They nest nicely and they fit in the dishwasher and come out looking good.  The vent is not that exciting a feature, but if it wasn't there you'd have more microwave clanup.   Regardless, I highly recommend these 
November 9,
 ++  Cuisinart ICE 30BC Pure Indulgence 2 Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  So far I have made several different ice creams in my new machine.  This is the first I'd ever had and the hard part is making the different recipies and deciding what you like and what you don't.  The machine is very efficient.  You just put the mixture in and it does all the work.  You may want to check on your mixture a few times because some thicken earlier than others.  You just stop it and give a taste to see if you like the consistency.  I made one mistake of putting the mixture in before it was completely cooled and it didn't thicken and I wasted all of it, so be sure it is completely cool before you put it in the machine.  The machine is a little noisy but I expected that after reading about it, not as bad as I thought it would be though.  Overall, very happy 
August 21,
 ++  Revere 3 Piece Mixing Bowl Set with Covers: Kitchen & Housewares ++  It was the perfect price and the cheapest that i found anywhere and i would recomend it to anyone

 ++  Fiesta 4pc Place Setting, Heather: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This color of Fiesta is just gorgeous and a great addition to any collection. My sister in law, for whom this was a gift, just loves it and I'd be tempted to buy a set for myself if I didn't already have a ton of dishes. The Fiesta line are all well made, solid dishes that can be used for all occasions.  If you know someone needing dishes, the Fiesta line is the way to go. These dishes increase in value regularly and add a lovely touch of color to your table

++  Corelle 6003893 Winter Frost White 10 Inch Plate: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I looked for somewhere to find these Corelle plates and found them on Amazon.  My favorite dish and plate design should last a while and withstand my abuse 
December 9, 
++  Corelle 6003893 Winter Frost White 10 Inch Plate: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This plate, the 10 inch is the normal size dinner plate, just so you know. It's easy to buy the wrong size with these because they come in so many sizes. My aunt has had the Winter Frost White as long as I can remember, and now I am slowly building my own collection. I love them   they are very light and strong. I tried throwing a plate on the kitchen floor and it is still intact. The material feels like a combination of porcelin and pyrex as weird as that sounds. They are so thin and light that I could probably carry at least 35 of them. This is perfect for your everyday meals. Highly recommended 
November 3, 
++  Corelle 6003893 Winter Frost White 10 Inch Plate: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The combination of the great price and incredible durability makes this stuff perfect for just about everyone.  Both I and my parents have been using Corelle dinnerware for over 15 years, and are amazed at how well they hold up 
November 10,
 ++  Black & Decker GC200/EM200 Gizmo  Can Opener, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Pretty good product.  We have not changed the batteries yet & it does get quite a bit of usage.  It's easy to use & not an eye sore in my kitchen.  Very fast shipping!  I would order again 
January 10,
 ++  Calphalon One Infused Anodized 14 Inch Everyday Pan with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I recently received this pan as a gift, and have been extremely impressed with it!  The "infused anodized" surface performs as advertised, providing a terrific hybrid between regular and non stick cooking.  I love the 14" size    it's great for those times when I used to have to split things up into more than one 10" saute pan, as well as for one pan stovetop to oven dishes.  That said, this is definitely not the right pan for you if you prefer non stick surfaces.  You will need to use oil, butter, etc. when cooking in this pan, and things will sometimes stick.  Cleanup is very easy, though!  It is very well constructed, and I would expect it to last a lifetime 
July 26,
 ++  Victorinox Chef's Knife, Black Fibrox, 8 in.: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is one of my favorite knives   and I have quite a collection of them, believe me.  It's sturdy, sharpens easily, and seems to contour to my hand when chopping.  I'm a faster sous chef for myself and others with this knife.  Great price, I might add.  This brand across the board is one of my all time favorites.  I've never been disappointed with a knife I purchased from Victorinox 
July 27,
 ++  KitchenAid KFPM770 Food Processor, Brushed Nickel: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The Food processor has many many organized accessories that were sent with the purchase. I know I was buying a good brand but it was not just a good product it's an Excellent food processor and worth more than the money. My wife LOVES you know guys waht that means. Also it has a juice maker not mentioned in the add woooow. The seller was more than Excellent. 
February 15,
 ++  Baker's Secret Basics Non Stick Large Loaf Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This low cost loaf pan does everything you would expect a loaf pan to do. It's dark color absorbs enough heat to produce desired browning. It also releases cleanly. The protruding lips serve as handles although if they were a little bigger they'd be easier to grip while wearing oven mitts). All in all, this is an excellent buy for a loaf pan   you should buy two since many recipes call for making two loaves

 ++  200 Thread Count King Cotton Sateen Duvet, Sand: Kitchen & Housewares ++   I love my Duvet cover.  It's extremely soft, softer than I expected.  The large buttons add to the charm.  I would buy another duvet cover in a heartbeat.   Denis 
December 25,
++  FoodSaver 1 Gallon Size Bags, 32 Bags: Kitchen & Housewares ++  These bags and all of the Foodsaver brand bags are flawless. The only way they would fail is if they are being used wrong. If you do Ebay you can get these same 32 count gallon bags for about $10.99 + $5.50 for shipping. And sometimes you can find a seller that will combine shipping for multiple boxes. I purchaced 3 boxes of gallon 32 cnt bags for $32.97 + $9.00 for shipping. Also keep in mind that you can wash and re use these bags as long as they did not hold any kind of meat and that they have never been boiled. I have used them multiple times for things like corn on the cob

October 24, 
++  KitchenAid Stainless Steel Oven Thermometer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've only had this thermometer for about a week, but so far, it does exactly what it's supposed to    stays in place at the back of the oven and displays the temperature using numbers large enough that I can read them easily without opening the oven door. Very satisfied 
December 27, 2001 ++  Hoffritz 2 Piece Stainless Steel Peeler and Parer Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  OK so I got this set for free, but I would have paid something for it.  The little peeler works fine but the parer isn't the sharpest knife in my knife block.  I've attempted to sharpen it but it doesn't hold an edge well 
January 7,
 ++  Pet Gear Home 'N Go Soft Sided Pet Crate, Large, Moss Green: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I suppose color choices would be nice; choice is almost always good.  But my smaller Golden loves it.  She likes the view it gives her and it's room and she doesn't paw at the sides.  My larger Golden 118 lbs   and no he's not fat; he's just a tall, tall Golden) would paw at the sides and that could spell disaster with this crate.

 ++  Bodum Assam 4 Cup Tea Press: Kitchen & Housewares ++  What you see is what you get.  It works just fine, there isn't really much that could go wrong.  The only thing is I should have gotten the larger size.  What they call a cup and what I call a cup didn't really measure up.  For me it makes two regular mugs 
June 25,
 ++  Bodum Assam 4 Cup Tea Press: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This teapot was a good buy all in all.  It's true about how the leaves container doesn't stay in a static position... this concerned me at first, but it hasn't been a problem.  The tea press will slide down over time without leaves in the pot, I put it in the leaves container on an angle and this stops that from happening.  I have never had a problem loosing heat to fast from this pot, contrary to previous reviews.  Yeah, some things could be better quality... but considering the price I'd call it a good buy

++  KitchenAid Bottle Opener, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I think you could do just about anything to this bottle opener and it would come out just fine. As noted by other reviewers, this opener has a wonderful substantial weight. It has Kitchenaid's signature quality and great color! Goes well with my other utencils and gadgets. Oh, it opens bottles very well too

 ++  Musso 4080 Lussino Dessert Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++       All the hype is true.  The sensations are sinful, but totally legal.  I'm still embarrassed that I spent that much money on a dessert maker, but I don't regret a penny of it.   When I clean the machine, I only wish I had a tongue long enough to lap up every drop.  I hide from the kids so I can lick the paddle blades alone.      "Normal" ice cream from this machine can send you into another realm, but Italian style gellato will deliver you to a level of transcendence previously thought impossible here on earth.  Slowly heat four cups of fresh cream in a large pot to just below a simmer surface will start to shimmer).  In a small pot, melt four ounces of best bittersweet chocolate on lowest heat.  In a large, deep bowl, beat four fresh egg yolks on high speed and gradually add 2/3 cups sugar.  Slowly pour the hot cream into the yolks and sugar.  Mix in 1/2 cup of ground chocolate Ghiardelli, for example).  Add melted chocolate and return to large pot.  Heat mixture to about 160 degrees, stirring frequently, and cook until it thickens about fifteen or twenty minutes).  Don't let it get above 165 degrees, or it might burn.  Remove from heat, cool, and place in refrigerator for at least an hour.  Pour into Musso, turn on machine, and prepare yourself.  Tell only your closest, dearest loved ones

 ++  Anolon Classic 10 Inch Nonstick French Skillet: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've had this cookware since 1991. It has performed exactly as promised. Regardless of all the use this is the hardest working piece in the set) It's in great shape. I use it for so many things, sauteing vegetables, a large omelette to share).  A 10" skillet is a must have and more than one is even better. Please never use aerosol cooking sprays.  A "pumped" spray is recommended or just pour a little oil or a pat of butter for more flavor. Great even heat and total release, even when cheese is used. Fast easy hand wash

 ++  W�sthof Come A Part Kitchen Shears: Kitchen & Housewares ++  These scissors are ideal for the kitchen. The size is nice, good grips fit well in the hand. They are sharp and appear to be easy to sharpen for the future. I especially like that they come apart easily for cleaning... and go back together easily also. Highly recommend if you're looking for a good quality, all purpose kitchen scissor 
August 13,
 ++  W�sthof Come A Part Kitchen Shears: Kitchen & Housewares ++  These shears are indispensable. First they are sharp and stay that way   definitely not to be used by children. They will definitely bone a chicken all by themselves but I spare mine a little by using poultry shears to cut heavier bone).Easy to handle. But best of all, they come apart and go back together with extreme ease, yet stay together for use. Contrary to the description, it is not necessary to use the cap and screw to get them apart. They are well designed with a slot and protrusion arrangement that allow them to be separated for CLEANING with a single motion and to be rejoined the same way. The cap and screw are only necessary for sharpening. You'll wonder how you ever got along without them

 ++  DeLonghi DSM7 Esclusivo 7 Quart Stand Mixer, Brushed Aluminum: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This item was ordered to replace a Kitchen Aid unit used extensively for a number of years.  I am a heavy gourmet baker and cater to very discriminating clients.  I first heard of the DeLonghi Mixer when it was branded Kenwood  in an Australian magazine.   What a nice difference!  The Kitchen Aid now appears to be so antiquated by comparison!!    I love the very practical easy to clean design and construction of the DeLonghi as well as the physical ability of the unit to mix more content in a more complete manner.  I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product.   
January 12,
 ++  DeLonghi DSM7 Esclusivo 7 Quart Stand Mixer, Brushed Aluminum: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was a KitchenAid fan.  I had the Special Edition 350 watt and burned the motor out twice in just a couple of years.  When it burned out the 2nd time I decided not to spend another $100+ on repairs.  I bought this Delonghi and love it.    The splash guard is great and convenient to use I'd never used the KitchenAid splash guard because it was too much trouble).  Now I don't know how I ever lived without one  no more white dust all over my counters.  The power is more than I'll ever need but at least I don't have to worry about burning the motor out.    It is very easy to change attachments.  You can even change them while the splash guard is on.    It is also very easy to clean.    Great Buy

I purchased this one when my old one rusted out and like it much better. It's just classy enough, without seeming snooty, and holds a nice amount of ice. Just fill it, stick it on your bar or table, and then you don't have to worry about continually opening up the freezer

You will hand this stuff down to your kids.  What's so special about it?  It out performs all of my other cookware yes, even All Clad) on the stovetop and in the oven.  The even heating is better than I could have imagined. It will even perform despite the crappiest cooktops.  And, as an added bonus, it's the easiest to clean.  I use mine for most everything . . . pot roast, soup, stew, pasta sauces, braising, slow cooking, etc.  It's great

 ++  Zelco Brisk Brew Travel Coffeemaker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I only use the Brisk Brew for heating water while on vacation....I'm a tea drinker.  My Ex husband got custody of the first one we bought, so the search was on.  When I couldn't find it in the stores I went on line.  As soon as I saw the exact same I ordered it.  It works great, and travels light!  
January 8,
 ++  Zelco Brisk Brew Travel Coffeemaker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Having now owned this device for three months, I found it to be a very useful device to have around if you need hot water and there isn't any or no way to get any. Its lightweight, very portable and compact. While listed as a coffee maker, it brewed very slowly and not all that well. But as a hot water heater, it served fantastically well. The typical 8 oz water will heat through the system in about 4 5 minutes, so little patience is needed. The device seem to overheat a bit so cool down period would be wise between uses.  There's an automatic shut off, the machine come with two plastic containers that fit inside the water hold. It also come with a small spoon. Machine often come on by itself even before you hit the "on" button, probably if you hit the button before you plug it in. I would recommended that you have everything set up before hand.  I used this device at work quite a bit and found it to be super handy thanks to the small size. The following products could be considered as tailored made for this device: Lipton Cup a Soup sheer perfect for this machine), General Food International coffee mixes and various kind of hot chocholate brands. It also great for tea bags as well. I am not sure about brewing tea though.  Overall, this device come highly recommended for anyone who might like to have a hot drink when there's none available

Oh well, maybe next time I'll come as a proctologist

++  Farberware Accents Silver 3 qt. Covered Stirring/Pouring Saucepan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have Le Creuset and Calphalon pots and pans but I find myself constantly reaching for this Farberware pot.  The design is why I bought it.  I would have been willing to pay $100 for one just like it from Calphalon or Le Creuset but this is the only one of its kind I could find anywhere online. It doesn't have the weight of my other pots but the sheer practicality of being able to strain your food without worries of burning yourself the spouts are great) or using another dish far outweights any reservations on possible durability.  Kudos to Farberware for coming up with such an ingenious and sensible design.  It makes one wonder if the other brands out there ever listen to their customers 
November 9,
 ++  Bunn NHB Professional Home Brewer, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this as a birthday gift to myself and I love it.  I thought I would miss being able to preset my coffee timer at night to wake up to coffee, but this makes it so quickly that has not been a factor.  The taste is unbeatable!  Even if you leave the warmer on the entire morning the coffee never tastes bitter.  Highly Recommended for coffee lovers!

January 25, 2002 ++  Le Creuset Stoneware 11 1/2 Inch Oval Dish, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This casserole dish has some minor inconveniences.  It's made of some sort of pottery so it cools down very slowly and it's easy to let something sit for 15 minutes and come back and burn your hand.  I also learned through this dish that square casserole dishes are easier to cut brownies out of than round or oval ones.  It does however cook things just fine and is not too large for what I need it for 
May 14, 2001 ++  Le Creuset Stoneware 11 1/2 Inch Oval Dish, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Le Creuset baking dishes are an investment in good cooking for a lifetime. This 11 1/2 Inch size oval dish is similar in size and shape to a medium sized au gratin. It is large enough to bake two large fish fillets or four boneless chicken breasts or a casserole. Many times, I double a casserole recipe and put half in this dish and then freeze it for later use. I bring the dish right from the oven to the table for serving, and I find its clean up is easy afterward

++  Capresso 112.05 EspressoPro ThermoBlock Pump Espresso Machine with FrothXpress: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The only complaint from the other reviews that I can agree with is that the amount of froth on the milk is hard to control.  I certainly don't have any trouble getting hot milk.  My taste in coffee is probably not very sophisticated, but this machine produces espresso and latte as good as I've had in America.  I've had my EspressoPro for 3 years and it's still working well.  When I first bought the machine, it didn't work, and the Capresso people were wonderful and immediately sent a new machine.  Then there was a mixup over the color silver vs chrome), and again the Capresso people were wonderful and sent a new machine.  Both times they sent me a machine immediately, with packaging to send my old machine back, so I had a new machine within two days of calling them.  I always use Espressione coffee pods, and filtered water.  That's just what is most convenient for me.  I've never actually cleaned the machine's innards, and I haven't noticed any degradation in performance over the years.  The milk attachment is very convenient.  We wash ours about once a week, although we do have to wash the little siphon/nozzle thing every day.  It's about as much work as a stainless jug I guess, with the advantage that you're not wasting milk every time you make a latte.  The downside to the milk attachment is that I haven't found a way to get a lot of froth out of it.  It's got a little knob on top that is supposed to control the amount of froth.  It does a good job of controlling the temperature of the frothed milk, but no matter what I do, I almost always end up with around 1/2 inch of froth on my latte.  Occasionally I end up with a lot more or almost none, but I have no idea why.  That's my biggest complaint.  The bit where the coffee comes out into your cup you can see my level of sophistication there) has two holes, so it can pour into two cups at once.  This is worthless.  The coffee never comes out evenly, and if you use pods you can only make a single shot at a time anyway.  The end result of the two holes is that whenever I make an espresso, some of it dribbles down the side of the cup instead of going in.  It's also a bit short for any latte glass I've ever found, and you have to tilt the glass to get it under.  Despite the fact that the EspressoPro doesn't look particularly tough it's mostly plastic, and not really heavy plastic at that), Mine is still going strong after three years.  Much to the dismay of my grandparents, three years is considered long enough to classify something as "durable" thesedays.  So there you go.  I'm sure there are machines that make better espresso, but for convenience, I haven't seen any machines that can touch this one for less than twice the price.  There are a couple of things I'd like to change milk froth control and height of coffee dispenser), but I would still recommend it

++  Cuisinart DCC 1200 Brew Central 12 Cup Programmable Coffeemaker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  When my Braun FlavorSelect coffee maker unexpectedly stopped working, I had to scramble to find a new machine. I wanted another Braun, but unfortunately, they seem to have stopped making a 12 cup coffee maker. So I had to begin an intense search for a machine that had the features I wanted combined with good value. I finally found it with this Cuisinart model.  The advantages? For one, it makes excellent and HOT coffee. The carafe is solidly constructed and fits securely in square body so there's no chance of someone accidentally knocking it loose. Because the lid fits tightly, the pour is precisely narrow and smooth, with no side leaks even when the pot is full. The basket fits inside the housing instead of swinging free like so many models which prevents a misalignment between the water and the filter; the conical Krups/Braun style) basket accepts both paper filters and gold tone, although I learned the hard way that not all gold filters fit. The timer is very easy to program, as is the clock. The carafe warmer can be set at low, medium, or high for the temperature that's right for you. I found the "high" setting too hot since I drink my coffee black I like my coffee hot but not scalding!), but those who add a lot of milk might appreciate it. The brewing is quick and efficient, with the process taking about a minute a cup, maybe less. The retro/stainless look complements most modern kitchen dcors. There's a 1 4 cup setting to make sure such small amounts stay hot, and you can select how long the warmer remains on. The pot beeps five times when brewing is complete and just before the warming plate shuts off. Parts are top rack dishwasher safe. It comes with a water filter system designed to improve the taste of the brew.  But the Cuisinart does have disadvantages. The water reservoir is located on the right side, in the back, which makes it a little challenging for lefties like me to dump the final bit of water inside even though the carafe pours very accurately. Although I haven't yet missed the opening, I do struggle briefly with those last few drops unless I use my right hand. The housing is fairly tall, so if your counter space is only under the cabinets, you may not be able to lift the top in its entirety. This is when the small rear reservoir becomes a major issue as you have to have room to completely lift the rather large top toward the back.) Clearance required: 7.5" wide by 8.5" deep of counter space with no overhead obstruction to pull out for filling OR 21.5" of overhead space to fully lift top. Without the top open, the coffee maker measures 7.5"w x 8.5"d x 14.25"h.  If you have the space for this coffee maker, you'll love it. I can't attest to how long it will last, but, as it comes with a three year warranty, I'm hoping for a good run

 ++  Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 12 Inch Open Skillet with Helper Handle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This pan heats up evenly, no hot or cool spots, and the handles stay cool.  It's great for cooking bacon or scrambling eggs.  Cuisinart recommends not turning the heat up to High, and so far, it hasn't been necessary.  Very good value.

I couldn't believe the price. Fortunately I have the lid from the previous pan because the cusinart doesn't come with one

 ++  KitchenAid KV25GOXBU Professional 5 Plus 5 Quart Bowl Lift Stand Mixer, Cobalt Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great.   At this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer

 ++  KitchenAid KV25GOXBU Professional 5 Plus 5 Quart Bowl Lift Stand Mixer, Cobalt Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have enjoyed my new KitchenAid.

 ++  Chicago Cutlery Insignia Matte 12 Piece Block Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've used this set for several years now  and have been very pleased with the overall cutting ability of these knives. Even though I also own Global and Shun kitchen knives, I find myself being drawn to the Insignia knives when I am in a hurry or in the middle of a large project. Although both the Global and the Shun have sharper edges, their price difference doesn't equate directly to the increased level of sharpness that you get. That is to say, yes Global and Shun knives are sharper, but they are not three to four hundred percent sharper all though their price difference certainly would suggest that.   Using my Insignia knives, I am able to quickly dice, cut, and slice through onions, carrots, chicken, roasts, etc. That said, there are several cavets that need to be stated. First, don't wash these knives in a dishwasher. It has nothing to do with the quality of the steel. I wouldn't wash my Ken Onion Shun Chef's knife in the dishwasher and that one knife costs as much as two whole sets of the Insignia. Second, these knives need to be honed regularly. A few strokes after every use makes a real difference. Third, after owning the knives for almost two years, I sharpened each of the knives on oil stones. These knives, like all knives will need to be resharpened from time to time. The good news is that they resharpened quite nicely, a tribute to their quality. Since resharpening, they have continued to hold their edges.   Last, the balance of these knives is more than adequate. I also own the matching sanduko and have found it to be the best of the series. All though I am a bit of a knife snob, and although I would love to purchase a block set of either the Shun or the Globals, I can't justify it given that the Insignia's cut so well. My wife would really give me no end of grief if I threw out a perfectly good set of knives. And a good set of knives these are

 ++  Bionaire BW2300 Twin Window Fan with Remote Control: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My living room approx 12'x16' and open to the kitchen) was always the last room to cool down after a hot day. It sometimes took most of the night to cool despite standing a powerful fan in front of it. The Bionaire BW2300 cools it in half the time it used to take.  ~Edit: My statement that this fan cools my liviing room in half hte time I once did is inaccurate. If the outside temp is lower than inside, the fan cools the living room in just a couple of hours.~  It also does a great job circulating air when its hot out and in) to keep the room from feeling stuffy.   I have not experienced the temperature gauge problem that other reviewers have. The temp gauge on mine works well.  ~Edit: The thermometer reads the temp of fan's exact location, not the room's temperature. For example, in the afternoon sun, mine consistently registers a much higher temp than the actual room tempature. When it is colder outside at night, it registers a slightly colder temp than the room temp. ~  Is it really quiet? Yes! I have a Vornado fan, which is quite quiet for a fan. This is even quieter although not silent).  To accomodate different window sizes, this model comes with a built in extender, and two add on extenders. The fan with extenders isn't large enough to fit my 38.5" window width. I could order another add on extender from the manufacturer, but stuffed a wash cloth in the gap instead.   What comes in the box? The fan, two extenders, two AAA batteries and the remote.   ~Edited 7/28/06: I bought a second one for my bedroom. Its thermometer is completely inaccurate and overstates the temperature until the outside temp is about 75 degrees.  The slats which the air blows through are fixed on this model. So I cannot direct the air onto or away from) a particular area of the room.

 ++  Krups KB720 1,000 Watt 5 Speed Blender with 60 Ounce Glass Jar: Kitchen & Housewares ++  A long time Krups customer, I purchased this blender after 10 years of suffering with a lack luster, non Krups blender, which was given to me as a wedding present. To say this is an outstanding blender would be an understatement. I'm amazed with how quiet the blender is and the best feature is how powerful it is. We use our blender for smoothies in the morning and my husband uses it for his nutrition drinks in the evenings, so we needed something that was durable, substantial and will last a long a time.  An excellent blender, it was a good investment for our household

++  Nordic Ware Nonstick Cooling Grid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is the best cooling rack I have ever seen.  I have used it primarily for cookies, but it works great for other baked goods as well.  Because of the small grid, nothing gets bent or broken.  The size is perfect for putting many cookies on to cool without trying to squeeze them together. Clean up is a breeze.  Just add a couple of recipes and this would make a very nice gift.  I know I wouldn't want to be without it

 ++  Chicago Cutlery Forum 7 Inch Santoku Knife: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I purchased this knife because my daughter didn't like using any of my knives; she wanted one like the chefs all use on Food Network.  I wasn't willing to pay the high prices of the professional ones so this was a good compromise, and I'm pleased with it.  It's nice looking, feels comfortable to hold, works well for chopping vegetables. Overall, a decent knife at a very reasonable price.

I absolutely love the set   the pans heat up very quickly and clean up beautifully. They're less expensive than many of the gourmet sets but just as good 
February 27,
 ++  Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 4 Quart Saucepan with Cover: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I purchased this product for two reasons: I own other Cuisinart cookware and like it very much...secondly, I frequently make spaghetti sauce with meatballs and find that a 3 quart saucepan just isn't large enough. The 4 quart size is perfect. For some reason I can't explain, my sauce tastes much better made in this saucepan 
October 29,
++  Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 4 Quart Saucepan with Cover: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I'm really glad to have replaced my non stick with the Cuisinart pans. I have been increasingly concerned about the safety of non stick. I was really scared that they would stick and I would have to scrub them, but they've been really good so far. I'm not crazy about the hazy look that the bottoms get inside, but I know it's because I cook on med high heat and I need to get some Barkeeper's friend. Overall, really pleased with this purchase, and I'm still adding to my set

 ++  OXO Good Grips 1052349 Seal & Store Rotary Grater, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I carefully read most of the reviews for this product before purchasing so I would know what to expect.  They mostly said the same thing:  either it broke or it worked perfectly.  The consensus seemed to say use only hard cheeses, and don't overcrank the handle.  We have only used it for parmesan cheese, and so far we've had no problems.  It works great so far 
March 16,
 ++  Capresso 201.01 FrothXpress Automatic Milk Frother, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Right out of the box and with skim milk, I have a latte that rivals the corner coffee bar.  Easy to set up, easy to use, easy to clean.  Can I ask for more?  What else is there 
September 17,
++  Black & Decker HS2776 Double Decker Flavor Scenter Steamer Deluxe Food Steamer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am replacing the same product that I have used continually for the past nine years or so. It has been an indispensable part of our kitchen all those years and we hope this new one will continue the tradition 
November 7,
 ++  Petstep 222 PetSTEP II Multi Purpose Dog/Pet Safety Ramp: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The Petstep II Multi Purpose Dog Sately Ramp was perfect for getting my black Lab, Blake, out of the water and over our sea wall.  He is over 90 pounds and it was sturdy and supported his weight.  He is very appreciative and so am I!  I would highly recommend this product and the seller selling it.  
September 10, 2003 ++  Calphalon Commercial Nonstick 5 Quart Saut� Pan with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have used mine for over a year now. I will never buy anything except this line of cookware in the future. Never sticks, easy to clean, after a year of everyday use family of 6) it's still in good shape! Note: We only clean it with a dobie pad as directed! Large enough to do four american toast at the same time. Great heat distribution. Just great, and BIG! Gave it to some friends as a present, they love it too. Glad I found it in this lifetime! Get it   I think You'll love it too! And No, I have no affiliation with calaphon 
July 2,
 ++  Le Creuset Panini Press and Skillet Grill, Flame: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This combo is awesome!  I've used coconut oil very little  it doesn't burn or smoke when heated) to season it and the press gets better with each use.  I use olive oil for the meat or bread I'm cooking and, although a steak wasn't seared as much as I would have liked, the pannini are outstanding.  The coconut oil seems to season without coloring so much and this is the first time in a very long life that I've correctly seasoned a pan.  Residue now just slips off with hot water and a natural bristled brush.  Please read the use and care instructions  I don't usually but for some reason sat down and did  you will find them very informative.  I love it 
May 12,
++  George Foreman GR70WHT Infusion Grill: Kitchen & Housewares ++  When I bought this thing 3 years ago I thought I might do kabobs on it but not only does it cook kabobs beautifully it also cooks tandoori chicken and tandoori bread!  I can't have an open flame grill where I live, and when I bought this I used it in the apartment.  Now I take it on my patio to grill.  I like the see through lid which most of these grills don't have.  It's too bad they've discontinued this produc

++  Bed Buddies Fleece Donut Pet Bed in Natural Vanilla: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Like the other reviewers, I have a cat who previously showed little to no interest in cat items   until I put this out.  It's now his regular spot to nap, and lounge.  
June 29,
 ++  Saeco Vienna Deluxe SuperAutomatic Espresso Coffee and Cappuccino Machine: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love my Vienna Deluxe!  We've been using it for 4 8 coffees per day for 7 months now and have certainly saved money over going to the coffee shop.  If you plan to buy more than 100 coffees for us about 3 months worth) it already pays for itself and the coffee tastes better.  The flavor of the coffee is awesome and it's super easy to make.    The only bad thing I can say about this coffee machine is that the 'key' in the back of it got a little bit off and we had to manually turn it so that the brew unit would fit back in.  It only took us about 2 hours to figure out and fix it, so it wasn't that big of a deal.      If you're looking for something that is a super high class, fancy, heavy duty, professional style coffee maker, maybe you should spring for the superdeluxe big bucks model and drop a couple grand.  People have given this model low reviews for being expensive and made of plastic.  Ours still looks nice, is easy to clean, and doesn't weigh 750 million pounds.  It seems like folks are looking for a chrome and steel Starbucks style coffee maker for $500, and that just isn't realistic.    This is a great buy and it makes great coffee 
September 13,
 ++  Simply Calphalon Hard Anodized Nonstick 9 1/2 Inch Stir Fry Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This pan is very easy to clean.  However, the small base won't sit stably on my gas range.  I keep a hand on the handle and pay attention to how it sits on the range to overcome the problem 
October 2,
++  KitchenAid K45WSSWH Classic Series 4 1/2 Quart Stand Mixer with Spatula, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I hav K5SS model of the Kitchen Aid Mixer and it has worked well for me when I do my cookies, cakes or mix ground meat for meat loaf. It is very easy and convenient to use.  Basically, I would want to inquire about other attachments for this model and how and where can I get them. I am from the Philippines. I am interested to purchase attachements like a sausage stuffer, grinder. Sorry for using this site, as I am lost where to get in touch with "Kitchen Aid Inc". thanks and please email me 
March 16,
 ++  500 Thread Count 100 Percent Cotton Queen Sheet Set, Ecru: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I don't think these are the highest quality sheet you will ever find as it has some thread coming out of the hem after a couple washes.  With that said, for the price, the sheets are very nice and feel soft after a couple washes.  
March 17,
 ++  Hoffritz Stainless Steel Mandoline Slicer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I can't begin to describe how worthwhile a piece of equipment this is.  It makes the best little potato shreds for potato pancakes, then, you just switch blades and slice up a little onion for them in the same bowl, which you can then mix the batter in.  The bowl component is my number 1 favorite feature of this little guy, but it just plain works really well 
January 13,
 ++  Chicago Metallic Commercial Cookie/Jelly Roll Pans, Set of 2: Kitchen & Housewares ++  These pans are mahvelous, dahling.  Having said that, I've read lots of reviews that included complaints about the strength of the adhesive used to stick the labels on the pans.  To one, to all:  There is a product called "GOO GONE" that is designed for just this type of thing.  You can find it almost anywhere, hardware stores, grocery stores, etc.  It works in minutes, and leaves no trace of the adhesive behind.  Just be sure the wash the pan afterwards.  Happy adhesive free baking

++  FoodSaver Continuous Roll Bag Material, 11 Inch by 18 Feet 2 Rolls): Kitchen & Housewares ++  These bags are durable and work everytime.  I like the size which seems hard to find locally 
January 13, 2003 ++  WMF Manhattan Stainless Steel Cocktail Shaker with Built In Strainer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I like this a lot.  It is very compact and easy to use. I like the built in ice strainer. You just slip off the cap and pour. No hassles of the top jamming and having to beat it open with a knife. You will need a finer strainer if you want to filter out citrus pulp, for example. But for most cocktails you are just straining out the ice. But I like this one for it's convenience 
November 8,
 ++  Zarafina Tea Maker Suite with Ceramic Tea Pots, Cups, and Serving Tray: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This machine is really a great invention   especially for those of us who have a tendency to spend on good tea and then screw up some part of the process that falls between the brewing and the first sip for example, infusing the tea for too long).  I think my tea will have more of a fighting chance with this new machine.  The design is great   quite classy, and I think it will be great for entertaining loved the way the tray that holds the machine could suddenly be converted into a serving tray for the well designed tea pot and cups).  Here is how it worked for me:  You pour your loose tea in the infuser basket, fill the tank with water, select the strength of your beverage and turn it on.  There's even a chance to choose which kind of tea you are brewing for optimal results for example oolong or green).  This nifty little machine will do the rest.  It will even pour the tea in the tea pot!  I'm finally enjoying my fine tea without the stress.  It's almost like having a tea butler in my house! 
April 29, 2003 ++  KitchenAid Silicone Mixer Spatula, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The KitchenAid line of silicone utensils are positively perfect.  They are very will made and excellent quality.  The silicone material is amazing, it is so easy to clean, whether you are using this mixing spatula with cake mix, cookie dough or anything you are mixing or scraping nothing will sticks to it.  The curved design on this spatula is a perfect match to the KitchenAid stand mixer bowl and it also works very well with my All Clad mixing bowls.  With this spatula you will not miss a drop of anything in the bowl.  Highly recommended 
February 4,
 ++  Bodum Assam 6 Cup Tea Press: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This tea pot, like their French Press coffee pot, is made of `magic glass'   it doesn't seem to break.  I'm hard on things and usually need heavy duty models just for every day survival.  I've had this tea pot for   maybe 8 years   unheard of for things around me. The glass just doesn't seem to break.  Others have spoken about how you use it to make tea   a brilliant idea.  But here's the other cool thing: when you get a `presentation' tea like say a `peony' tea that opens into a flower or say, a sea shell tea like peets.com sells that opens up into an oyster looking shell with a string of jasmine flowers as `pearls' floating above it   you can SEE the magic unfold and enjoy the beauty and art of the tea unfolding if you leave the infuser out and just let the folded tea do what ever it does.  The ONLY down side is that the cap won't fit on the tea pot if you take the infuser out.  But I have never found that to be a problem.  The tea MAY cool a bit faster   but not so much so that it bothers me.  The fact that it is glass and has outlasted so many hand thrown ceramic tea pots I've had speaks to it's wonder and durability.  Like I said, this is made of magic glass. 
July 10,
 ++  Cuisipro Stainless Steel Measuring Cups and Spoon Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have purchased many different brands of measuring spoons and cups in the past but these are by far the best!  Heavy but not too heavy to use) so the handles don't bend or float around in the dishwasher), shaped well so they fit into containers and spice bottles easily, easy to level and the measurement markings will not fade away they are engraved).  I love my set...will definately buy another set cooking is my hobby)

 ++  MIU France Silicone Basting Brush with Stainless Steel Handle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Fantastic, works perfectly, easy to clean, much more sanitary than a n old fashioned bristle brush.  Also gentler on the pastries or breads 
March 5,
 ++  Fiesta Tangerine 495 70 Ounce Casserole with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Boy, do I LOVE this piece! I got mine for a LOT less at an outlet store and it's just wonderful. I LOVE the purple color   it's just gorgeous in a tuscan kitchen and this piece looks marvelous on the table. It does wonderfully in the oven   it's not overly big so don't get it to feed a family of 5 or so.  It's about 1.5 quarts.  I get tons of compliments on these pieces and the purple, well, it's just original and if you're afraid of it, don't be. It's just a gorgeous color and one that I'm very glad to have introduced into my kitchen. I'm getting more! Highly recommended piece. 
March 18,
++  KitchenAid Silicone Turner, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is the best spatula I have ever owned, and I have owned entirely too many. It is strong and wide and slightly curved at the front edge to fit my pans. The front edge is also nice and thin so it slides right under any food. And it cleans up like magic no holes for junk to get stuck in. And you can rest it right on the skillet without it melting or lay it on the counter because the handle is curved in such a manner as to keep the head from resting on the countertop. Seriously the best spatula ever 
November 30, 2002 ++  WMF Profi Plus Stainless Steel Jar Lid Opener: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This tool makes even the toughest jar a breeze to open, accommodating a range of sizes easily. I'm sending one to everyone in my family this Christmas 
March 14,
 ++  OXO Good Grips 38891 6 Inch Double Rod Strainer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Finding the right items to start the perfect kitchen for two is so easy thanks to OXO.  I love their good grips products.  All the handles look great, but are also very comfortable and practical.  This strainer fits in well to a kitchen for feeding 2 or 3 people.  You can use this double rod strainer not only for straining, but also for sifting flour, draining, and if need be   awkwardly steaming veggies over boiling water.  It seems most people might go for the 8" instead, but this one works perfectly for making gnocchi from scratch.  You have to make few enough in each batch that they can all rise to the top at once.  Then you scoop them all up with the strainer the bigger strainer may be hard to fit in many pots).  Drain the gnocchi and place on a paper towel.  Since you can do all this with one hand, you can use your other hand to grab more gnocchi to start a boilin' quick as can be.  Whatever you use it for, this is a high quality strainer that will last 
August 15,
 ++  Rubbermaid 20&#45;pc&#46; Stain Shield Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Read the reviews and ordered....  Don't regret it at all.  Will be ordering more for gifts and myself.  I have problems with my hands, but have not found the lids to be a problem AT ALL.  Just start on one side and gently push your way around the lid...Goes right on, nice and snug.  Can't comment on the breaking issue.  Just hasn't happened.  Maybe if item is dropped immediately after removing from the freezer??????  But, under normal conditions, I've had no problems.  Crystal clear, easy to clean, stacks just fine.  Don't regret my purchase and as stated, will be getting additional sets.  
October 2,
 ++  Breville EW30XL Gourmet Wok: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I immediately noticed the quality of this wok as soon as I took it out of the box. Very nice looking. Very easy to cook in. It's big and has large sides so it is very easy to stir the stir fry around without spilling it. The non stick surface works beautifully. Reattaching the wok to the base after cleaning is fairly easy although the wok never seems to lock 100% correctly into place without a little hassle. I'm not sure it really matters if it's not perfectly 100% aligned into the base anyway. Nevertheless, that's only a minor gripe. This wok makes stir fry easy and fun and makes the food taste really good. The included spatula was a nice gesture, too. The instructions say the wok can do a lot of other things too, like slow cooking, but I only use it for stir fry 
March 25, 
++  Riedel Vinum Bordeaux Wine Glasses, Set of 6: Kitchen & Housewares ++  These glasses DO work and in much more distinct way that I could have ever imagined. I have bought many Riedel glasses to my wine lover friends and they absolutely love it too. You got to try them to believe it. You won't regret it  
January 1,
 ++  Kitchen Essentials&#174; from Calphalon&#174; Hard Anodized 4&#45;qt&#46; Sauce Pan with Cover: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This pot is a perfect medium sized saucepan. The double handles are a great feature. We use it at least once a day in our kitchen. The non stick surface is extremely durable, although I'm not sure I would use metal utensils with it. I use a blue scrub sponge to clean it. I'm not sure I would use the more abrasive, green 3M pads. Overall a very durable, high quality cooking utensil. In fact I'm back here today to buy one for a friend 
November 5,
 ++  Pyrex Prepware 3 Piece Measuring Cup Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love having these Pyrex cups in varying sizes.  The large ones are great for mixing and pouring batter, like pancakes.  The smaller one let's you measure once, to get 1 1/2 or 2 cups of liquid 
June 16,
 ++  Pyrex Prepware 3 Piece Measuring Cup Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Ok, it's June and you are being hit up for present after present and you are on limited funds. No need to feel depressed. You can give this measuring cup set and hold your head up, knowing you gave something that won't be sneered at or find its way to the return pile by the blushing bride.  Everyone needs these cups to do cooking, from the large size for soup and broth to the small size for baking. And I will confess, I've used the medium sized one as an emergency gravy boat. So it doesn't look quite as nice as a cut glass gravy server  it works JUST fine.   I also use the glass cups for mixing batters to pour out right from the pitcher, and I use them for prepping foods like stir fry when you have to have a bunch of ingredients ready to hand to dump at once into the wok.   
August 15,
 ++  T Fal 1749 Ultraglide Diffusion Iron: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Best iron I ever owned.  I read the reviews before purchasing and was not disappointed.  No one likes to iron, but this one makes it a little easier 
November 9,
 ++  Calphalon Stainless Steel Collector's Edition 4 Piece Multi Pot Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Very sturdy construction and I like the glass lid. The only problem I have is the lid has a VERY thin metal that is easily damaged. The pot is thick and the handles are riveted on and very solid. As long as you are careful with the lid, this steamer is awesome 
August 2, 2002 ++  Airbake by Wearever Natural Oblong 13 by 9 Inch Baking Pan with Cover: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had traditionally used pyrex cake pans and wasn't completely satisfied with the results. Just recently, I purchased the AirBake cake pan after having successful results in their line of cookie sheets. I am completely satisfied with this pan and recommend getting rid of the traditional pyrex

 ++  Dolce Dark Walnut Folding Bookcase: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love this shelf. I have two. You just take it out of the box and the shelves fall into place. No screwdrivers, nothing to assemble. Its fabulous. 
September 11,
 ++  Cuisinart Ice 45 Mix It In Soft Serve Ice Cream Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I purchased the Mix It In on 9/8/06 and used it the next day.  I never got soft serve.  I froze the bowl again, this time in my upright freezer, and made the mix the day before and refrigerated it for 15 hours.    Today, I made soft serve!!!!!!  It isn't perfect but I'm well on my way.  I have been making the low fat version but I think the regualar version will be excellent. To make this machine work for you here are some pointers: 1.  If you don't have an upright or chest freezer, put the bowl in the back of your regular freezer.   2.  Freeze the bowl for as long as possible beyond the suggested 12 hours.   3.  You can forget the 12 15 minute check described in the manual.  You will not have a chance of having soft serv before a minimum of 25 minutes.  I mixed as long as 40 minutes.   4.  SAVE YOUR RECEIPT.  Since the ice cream takes twice as long to mix as is suggested in the manual, you are using the motor 2x as much.  Therefore, you might have to use the 3 year warranty.

++  KitchenAid KTT570BU 4 Slice Digital Toaster with Bagel, Warm, and Frozen Functions, Cobalt Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We've had this toaster for over a year and my family loves it. It toasts consistently. It accommodates all widths. And the digital selector is great 
October 18,
++  Oneida Stanhope 53 Piece Stainless Steel Flatware Set, Service for 8: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I thought this set was cute in the picture, but was so excited when it actually came! It is truly a beautiful set. I have run them through the dishwasher a number of times already and they come out looking like new, and my husband loves the "larger than normal" size. I have little hands & I really like them too  they are very sturdy. The biggest bonus, other than the 8 settings plus the 5 piece serving set, is the extra 8 teaspoons!

February 24,
 ++  Pacific Coast Feather Classic California King Feather Bed Cover: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The main problem with my bed was the featers were pocking me while I was sleeping no matter what I put on the top of the feather bed. Not anymore after I bought this magic cover. Now I can enjoy my new bed without paying the price of being tortured all night by the small needle like feathers :) 
August 9,
 ++  OXO Good Grips 1061863 Mini Angled Measuring Cup 3 pack: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Although small, these little cups come in really handy.  Have small amounts of liquid to measure before you measure those tablespoons of sugar or flour?  Now you don't need to be concerned, just use a little OXO cup and move on!  I use them every time I bake and leave the measuring spoons dry or completely alone.  Just love them and need another set 
June 19, 2000 ++  Henckels Pro S 4 Inch High Carbon Stainless Steel Paring Knife: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Henkel Pro S knives are second to none.  They will last a lifetime and make a tremendous difference in your cooking.  These knives take the 'chore' out of cutting vegis 
February 3,
 ++  Calphalon  Traditional 2 Piece Knife Set with 8 Inch Chef's Knife and 5 Inch Santoku Knife: Kitchen & Housewares ++  the 8" chef's knife is a little heavy, but other than that, they both work great so far...especially for the price. i've used them daily for a month, and they have not lost their sharpness at all. 
February 2,
 ++  Henckels Twin Signature 7 Piece Block Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Henckels Twin Signature 7 Piece Block Set is exactly what I'd hoped that it would be: a quality set of knives that is ideal for the home.  The set of Henckels that I've owned since the mid 80s finally gave in to a lot of use, sharpenings and dishwashings dishwashing a good knife is a nice way to shorten the handle's life expectancy!). But 20 years of great service from my previous set of Henckels certainly warranted a loyal update/upgrade to another Henckels set.  And I am not disappointed. The new set is quite sturdy. Home users will be impressed with their strength; pros might be used to a higher standard, but I used to work in a professional kitchen and I can't see how these would not be as effective as anything a pro has.   These knives come out of the box SHARP too...a lot sharper than the sharpest that I've ever had my previous set sharpened to.   There were two descriptions from Amazon that tell you what you get; one of Amazon's descriptions included a carving knife product description) and the other a peeling knife what's in the box). Amazon seems to have corrected the error as of this updated 2 13
 writing. To be sure, here's what you actually get:    2 1/2" peeling knife    4" paring knife   5" serrated knife   8" chef's knife...this baby cuts through a roast like a hot knife through butter even though it's designed for chopping and dicing. In my opinion, it's better than a carving knife.   a sharpening steel   kitchen shears    and a storage block with 11 slots which is great because some of the knives, especially the serrated knives, from my old set are still in mint shape like the 8" bread knife), so there's plenty of room in the block for knives in your current collection looking for a new place to sleep.  No 8" carving knife. But like I said above, the 8" chef's knife works better than any carving knife that I've used.  The only things missing from this set for the average home is a nice large bread knife as I said this was not a problem for me) and steak knives also not a problem as most households already have these). Plain and simple, this is a great set of food preparation knives that  if my previous set is any indication  will last for decades.  Bon Appetite.   
January 15,
 ++  Henckels Twin Signature 7 Piece Block Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  A very solid knife set, especially with the extra slots for those who have a few "favorite" knifes left in the drawer.  MAKE SURE when you buy Henckels to get the "twin" set instead of the single little henckel man, that's a big upgrade in quality.  Oh, and for goodness sake people, quit putting your knife set through the dishwasher and just clean them as you go

July 11,
 ++  Proctor Silex Fifth Burner: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Great product. I am using this because my kitchen is under remodelling. Works great with smaller vessels. Heats up evenly. I give 4 points because I am annoyed by the bulb on the stove. It is ON as long as the burner is connected to power. I would rather have a burner which has bulb to show if the burner is ON/OFF. 
September 14,
++  Roul'Pat Pastry Mat: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The French made Roul'pat, like its cousin the Silpat, is a flexible silicon mat enclosing a thin, fiberglass mesh for durability. The Roul'pat is designed for creating a non skid work surface for rolling out and kneading dough. The tacky surface adheres to the counter without clinging to the dough, making it easier to roll out thin pastry crusts and the like. Because the mat is flexible, the transfer of a pie crust to pan is a cinch. Dipped chocolates don't stick, nor does fondant. At sixteen and a half inches by twenty four, the surface is expansive enough for most recipes. The only drawback to this unusual mat is the inability to cut on it, ruling out anything that requires a cookie cutter or knife. The manufacturer also warns against folding and scraping the surface.  I find the Roul'pat works best on pie crusts, pizza dough, chocolate, and flatbreads or any bread dough that requires rolling or shaping.) Clean up is simple   wipe with a damp sponge and rinse. Mild soap can be used if needed, although I try to keep the surface detergent free. The Roul'pat is not dishwasher safe.)  This makes a fantastic gift for cooks who seem to have everything 
September 1, 2003 ++  All Clad LTD 11 Inch Square Nonstick Grille Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've owned this grill pan for almost 2 years now and it does a great job of grilling everything from burgers to chicken, fish and thick steaks. It has the ability to heat up to a very high temperature, enabling me to nicely sear the outside of the meat. I can then pop the whole pan in the oven to finish cooking the inside of thick steaks or just to keep warm. As for clean up, the pan does need to sit and soak for a little while but after that, everything comes off with relative ease. No hard scrubbing involved. Overall, I love this product and highly recommend it 
July 8,
 ++  Professional Series Tortilla Baker   PS75791: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I purchashed the Professional Series Tortilla Baker PS75791 to add healthy tortillas to my diet. I grind my own wheat berries and grow my oun yeast to make bread that is as fresh as it can be and is completed in 4 hours after grinding. A loaf cost just about 15 cents. I wanted to make freshly ground wheat tortillas for the cost savings and for the superior nutrition. I am very pleased with the results. I grind my wheat, but leave out the oil because I submurge my doe in olive oil so it will keep fresh for days in my frig and then work the oil into the doe just before pressing and cooking. The machine really works, and its easy to use. It a quality machine and is a mainstay of my healthy kitchen 
January 2,
 ++  HOLMES HA CP7WUC 7 Inch Clip on Fan   White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This sturdy little fan has been working well for months.  One quibble: its two speeds are medium & fast.  There is no "slow."  Overall, I'm a happy customer

March 31,
 ++  Revere 2 1/3 Quart Whistling Tea Kettle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have used a Revere teakettle for 41 years. To clean it...all you need to do is take some Easy Off oven cleaner spray type) and spray the stainless steel part. This cleans all the grease spatters and any other spatters you get on it. Leave the Easy Off on until you see that you can wipe off the stains. Wipe, rinse and dry. It will look brand new 
September 17,
 ++  Bodum Canteen Double Wall Cooler/Beer Glasses, Set of 2: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love the function of these glasses.  We were given some of these Bodum double wall glasses and immediately saw the quality difference.  They will not sweat, they will keep your cold stuff cold, etc.  I have two down sides...  These must be handled gently, they are not that thick or hearty.  Until we realized what was going on, we cracked two by having our refigerator ice dispensor throw cubes into them, cracking them.  Plus I yanked the dishwasher open fast, knocking one over into something solid, and it broke.    But overall, if you handle them with a bit of care, they are really neat glasses

 ++  Bodum Canteen Double Wall Cooler/Beer Glasses, Set of 2: Kitchen & Housewares ++  While these are described as "beer" glasses, they are fantastic for keeping milk cold through a meal.  I actually pour the milk and place the glasses in the freezer while I start dinner.  These glasses are easy to clean and retain their "sunny" shine, even though we have very hard water.  NO SPOTS!  Great product 
December 26, 2002 ++  Nordic Ware Platinum Nonstick Cast Aluminum Bavaria Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  When you bake with the Bavaria pan, you can be sure that the finished product is consistent in shape everytime. The pan bakes evenly and there is a crispness of form when the cake is unmolded

++  Tablemate II: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This tablemate is perfect for anybody.It has many uses around the house which i could list but it would take to long. It is sturdy enough to hold about 20 to 30 lbs.when the tray is at its level position. The 3 positions is a plus because it gives you more options.The one thing that is a negative is the legs do not fold down completely for storage but everything else folds downtable top and the small bar.other than the legs not folding this is a five star

 ++  Pyrex 3 Piece Glass Mixing Bowl Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I knew what I was buying, so there weren't any surprises. The only thing I do not like about them is the shallowness; I wanted that feature for storage, but I didn't take into account how easy it is to be messy when mixing. I would suggest having another bowl around for use with an electric mixer. I like them, and I would buy them again..

 ++  Roshco Silicone Four In One Loaf Pan with Sled, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I just ADORE silicone bakeware!!!  I don't own this particular pan, but I'm replying to the first review. This pan, according to the description, measures 17 4/5 by 7 & 4/5 by 2 inches. I'd imagine that the individual loaves would probably measure approximately 8 by 3 & 1/2 inches, a good size for, for instance, zucchini bread loaves intended as Christmas gifts 
May 28, 2003 ++  Kaiser Bakeware ExtraordinAire 16 by 14 Inch Nonstick Cookie Sheet: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This pan works SO great! I have used it for cookies, biscuits, and pizza. Nothing has burned or stuck. SUPER EASY to clean, you can wipe it off with a paper towel and stick it in the dishwasher or just rinse it with a sponge and soap and everything just slips right off. GREAT PRODUCT!

 ++  BRAND NEW FOLDING DOG CAT KENNEL CRATE CAGE 30": Kitchen & Housewares ++  This product has been great.  The price is about half similar sized crates you can find at a pet store.  The only difference is the metal is a little thinner but if your dog is not aggressive, it should be fine.  Also, their is only one side door, doesn't have the 2 door options that higher priced crates have, BUT that didn't matter in our case.  This door was actually larger and our puppy found it easier to go in and out.  For the price, it's a great product

 ++  Sunbeam Hot Shot Beverage Machine: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I got a Sunbeam Hot Shot about 6 years ago.  It had been recommended by someone at work.  I used it at work every day and still do)    and have since bought another for home. It makes 2 cups of hot water    and is great for everything  including tea, instant oatmeal and hot chocolate.  When my daughter was younger, it was great for her because she could make her own hot chocolate or instant macaroni and cheese, and I wouldn't have to worry about her being burned on the hot stove. With the hot shot, you just pour your water in the top and hit the "heat" button.  The machine will then shut itself off when the water is hot and you can dispense the water.   This is a great product and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants fast, convenient,  and safe heating for hot water

 ++  All Clad LTD 12 Inch Round Nonstick Grille Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  First thing we cooked in this pan were burgers, and we could not believe the difference in taste compared to pan fried.  The raised ridges really carmelize the meat, and even when cooked well done the burgers are juicy.  We have prepared chicken, pork chops and fish, and they are all at least as good as charcoal grilled.  I would give this pan 10 stars if I could

May 3,
 ++  Henckels International Fine Edge Pro 3 Piece Knife Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Purchased these to go with a 7 inch Henckels International santoku that I've been using for years, and the phrase that comes to mind to describe all Fine Edge cutlery is "good enough."  No, it isn't restaurant quality, and yes, if you put these through the dishwasher they'll tarnish and probably even start to rust any metal designated as "stainless" is rust resistant rather than rust proof, and reviewers of other Henckels products complaining about rust and tarnish probably aren't treating their knives very well).  As a graduate student on a budget who enjoys cooking, but doesn't always have the time for it, these knives are an ideal compromise between price and quality.  Be aware that they will occasionally require sharpening   I've had the santoku for almost three years and run it through a commercially available ceramic disk sharpener every few months and it still cuts very nicely   and should probably be hand washed for longest life.  With that little bit of maintenance, however, this three piece set can meet nearly all of your cooking needs it meets all of mine, but then I don't often dress poultry, filet my own fish, or do much that would require a cleaver or really subtle boning knife) for quite a nice price

++  Vornado EH1 0028 06 Digital Vortex Heater, DVTH EH1002806: Kitchen & Housewares ++  After reading all the reviews and hearing about this on the radio, I went ahead and shelled out $100 for this.  I had really high expectation, having never spent so much for a heater before.  I have happy to say that I am completely satisfied.  This heater doesn't overwhelm and dry out the room with too much heat.  Instead it circulates the heat over time you should probably give it a good half hour to properly heat the whole room) evenly heating the whole room and leaving absolutely no cold spots.  After spending some time in my room, I had completely forgotten how cold it was outside.  Other bonuses are that it is very easy to operate and has a thermostat so you can set it to the exact termerature that you want your room to be.  My only minor complaint is that for its price, it should have included a remote control.  Otherwise, it is a wonderful heater

 ++  Scoop Free LB1 Self Cleaning Litter Box: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The litter box is good if you have a cat that does not scratch.  My cat sometimes tears up the box with her claws so I have to keep an eye on her and the box for leaking and holes.  Other then that the chystals are excellent for odor 
October 23,
 ++  Scoop Free LB1 Self Cleaning Litter Box: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have to say that I have tried almost all of the self cleaning litter boxes out there for my Large Male 14year old cat.  He has the electric water fountain for kitties and yes he does drink lot and lots of water, so you know what that means, yes, he pees a lot.  Oh yea he is a larger not fat) kitty so he eats a lot also, I aint sayin no more on that subject.  It has now been 25 AMAZING!!!!!! SCOOP/POOP/PEE CLUMP/URIN ODOR/POOP SMELL/LOTS & LOTS & LOTS OF ANOYING TRACKED SANDY LITTER .......................FREE DAYS!!!!!  This is not saying that this litter box does not have any room for improvement, but I am one happier kitty owner.  I will tell anyone that hates Doody & Pee Clump Duty, or that hates the tracked litter mess and nasty clumped up metal or plastic) rake & plastic that never fits right storage container, get this litter box.  The main gripe I have with this litter box is the cost of the replacement crystal litter cartridges, but I have been told by numerous pet store owners and workers that there will probably be a generic competitor on the market soon which will hopefully bring the price of the litter cartridges down.  One can only hope!  But regardless, I am keeping this auto waste center for my cay.  The other gripe, but not major problem I have seen so far, is with the cardboard for the cartridge that the litter sits in.  Now my cat, with a regular clumping litter box had clumps the size of softballs.  After 25 days, there is, on the bottom of the inside tray, not the bottom one that actually touches the floor and acts as the cover when you throw the thing out) a wet spot in the area that my cat likes to urinate at, apparently this is his favorite spot to pee.  On the bottom cardboard tray the one that touches the floor and acts as the cover when you throw the cartridge out) there is just the hint of a wet spot.  I think that if they increase the wax content in the cardboard or if that is what is actually coating the cardboard this will help.  I have not had to realign the rake as other people have said they had to do.  I do not smell any urine or poop and there is a lot of shrunken poop under that cardboard tray cover.  I have minimal tracked crystal litter on the floor around and/or under the litter box.  The motor is not as quiet as I would like, but then again it doesn't bother me or wake anyone in my house up either, it is kept on a wooden floor right out side the bedroom door in a hallway.  If you are in the market for an almost maintenance free litter box for your cat, try this one.  Like I said earlier, it's not 100% perfect, but it is the best damn self cleaning, almost maintenance free litter box on the market.  Not every kitty or human for that matter poops and pees that same, so if you don't try it you will never know if it's right for you and your kitty/kitties.  Read all the rest of the reviews for this and other products and see what everyone is saying about all of them, make an educated decision  Good Luck

 ++  Hamilton Beach 65117 Eclectrics All Metal Retro Drink Mixer, Licorice: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this product back in July
and have been using it to make my morning protein shakes.  It does a good job of it.  I cannot comment on its ability to make icecream as I try to stay away from that stuff.  The unit has a very solid construction.  The stainless steel glass is great.  I just drink my shake from it.  So it saves me from having to wash another glass.  I just have one small issue with it.  You cannot remove the spindle to clean it. You have to use the stainless steel glass with warm, soapy water, put it under the spindle and then rotate it around to clean it.  Well, the problem is this   while I am drinking my shake, the spindle is dripping liquid on the part of the unit that flares out on the bottom.  Okay, okay, it's no big deal, I suppose.  All in all, I like this product, and I would recommend it.

 ++  Calphalon One Infused Anodized 10 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I LOVE this set.  This was the first "real" cookware I've ever bought.  My husband and I did months of research before purchasing this set.  We've had it now for about 2 months and I can't express how much we've enjoyed it.  I've read several reviews that say food sticks and so on, but I think that perhaps those people think that because it looks similar to non stick, it is.  It's not!  Think of it like this:  It cooks like stainless steel and cleans up like non stick maybe even better!).  We almost went with the All Clad, but we just couldn't get over how uncomfortable the handles were.  Since I haven't cooked with All Clad, I can't compare the Calphalon One to it, but I will say they heat evenly and cook evenly.  Clean up is SUPER easy!  Just this morning I made bacon and french toast.  I looked at the pans and thought "There is no way I'll ever get this clean!"  I poured some Bar Keeper's friend on it and went to work with my Scotch Brite pad and within MINUTES it was spotless!  Fantastic 
May 11,
 ++  Calphalon One Infused Anodized 10 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My fiance and I registered for this set and we were thrilled when my parents got it for us.  I have been an avid home cook for over 10 years and have never had a complete set of cookware.  This is exactly what the Dr. ordered!  Here's why: 1)  Heavy, sturdy construction.  These things can take a beating.  They heat evenly and hold heat very well. 2)  You can use metal utensils with them.  I hate plastic spatulas!  We all know that we aren't supposed to use metal with non stick pans but we all do and then after a while our pan is a useless, peeling shadow of its former self.  Well this isn't the case with Calphalon 1!  Scrape away with any device you have at your disposal with no fear.   3)  They "stick" and sear as well as cast iron cookware it's a good thing).  This is the best feature for me.  Coated non stick cookware has its place but if you like to pan sear and get those tasty browned bits for sauces you used to have to use a pan that's not non stick such as stainless steel or cast iron.  They "stick" for a reason.  You need that contact with the cooking surface to get that great browning.  Now there's the Calphalon 1 which sears as well as cast iron pans but cleans up like a non stick pan.  It's a no brainer!   4)  They look cool, have great handles, they're oven safe, and they come with a lifetime warranty.    These are not cheap.  If your primary goal in cookware is super easy cleanup then don't buy this expensive set.  It will dissapoint you.  But, if you want the advantages of traditional cookware combined with easier cleanup in a durable, functional set, and are willing to shell out the $$$ for a top of the line product then this is for you.  Serious cooks who need the correct tools will love this cookware 
August 19, 2003 ++  All Clad Stainless Roti Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a great roasting pan and is heavy and solid in the way all All Clad pans are. But it is huge. If you frequently roast 20 lb turkeys or half an ox, this pan is for you. A regular roasting chicken looks pretty small and forlorn. It is a terrifically well made roaster, but I find I also need one just a bit smaller

 ++  Krups 203 42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  If you have problems with gripping those round coffee grinders, this one is for you! It's oval shape makes holding it much easier than a round grinder. It grinds well and quickly and is a breeze to clean with just a few flicks of a pastry brush dedicate one specially for this as it will discolor over time). It's the shape that makes it great

++  Taylor Classic Candy and Deep Fry Analog Thermometer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a great thermometer, easy to use and very accurate. It is an essential tool in the kitchen for making perfect candy recipes each time. You should always test your thermometer in boiling water by reaching 212F or 100C before you use it. I like the clip that allows you to attach it to the side of the pot. It's easy to read and dishwasher proof. It's the best!

++  Chicago Metallic Commercial 12 cup Mini Cheese Cake Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My dish for the holidays is always mini cheesecakes.  It was always frustrating to get them out of my mini muffin pan.  This pan has made it so easy!  I no longer dread making this dessert.  Just a note though... the cups on this pan are approx twice as big as a regular mini muffin pan so adjust your recipe accordingly.  I just double my recipe and get bigger mini cheesecakes.  I don't think anyone will mind

++  All Clad 3 Quart Stainless Double Boiler Insert: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I never really noticed the inner groove as a "problem" until I read the other reviews. This was part of my first All Clad set  so nice! Yes, things stick in the groove, but I just use a silicone spatula while cooking and I don't seem to have a problem.  I love the capacity and size/shape of this unit. Scrambled eggs come out beautifully in this pot, as does chocolate ganache and buttercream frosting. But sometimes my pumpkin pie filling gets bits of cooked egg if I'm not diligent about stirring out the groove. The width/depth ratio allows me to really get my whisk or spatula inside to work.   Sometimes the dishwasher horrors, I know!) doesn't get the groove completely clean. I hand wash it most times anyway, so that doesn't really matter too much to me.  I like the length of the handle, but I wish it were slightly thicker to make it easier to grab when using a pot holder 
July 24,
 ++  Cuisipro Donvier Yogurt Cheese Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had never tried yogurt cheese before, but I was intrigued by the idea.  Making the yogurt cheese was simple with this device   just fill with yogurt and leave it in the fridge.  The product seems sturdy and was easy to clean.  We grow our own raspberries, and I have been eating them with ice cream.  Last night I tried eating them with non fat yogurt cheese sweetened with a bit of sugar.  It was delicious and much healthier!  Yogurt cheese is a good source of calcium and protein   half a cup has 85 calories, 10 grams protein, 10 grams carbohydrate, and 235 mg calcium. It would be great for layering with fruit in parfaits 
August 21,
++  Hamilton Beach 24645 4 Slice Bagel Toaster: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We were looking for a toaster to toast thicker breads such as bagels.  The toaster does this and more.  There is a bagel button you press when toasting bagels and only the outside heating coils come on and toast the center of the bagel!  This is how I like them to be toasted.  The toaster also has a basket that holds the bread/bagel in place while it is being toasted.  This feature is really nice when toasting soft things such as pop tarts.  Good variance of heat controls too.  I have not found anything bad on this one.  Good choice 
December 10, 2002 ++  Emile Henry Couleurs Butter Pot, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Butter can be better when served in a truly elegant country butter pot. Emile Henry Couleurs does not fail. Buy it, you will  love it. And, have something absolutely unique    no kidding

And the coffee comes out delicious 
February 24,
 ++  Rival 3735WN 3 1/2 Quart Slow Cooker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought one of these for my daughter for Christmas and I got this particular one because it had all the attributes she wanted.  She wanted it to be small ehough for just two people and to be able to remove the bowl for cleaning.  This was the ONLY one I found with those attributes.  There were 1 qt. size that were too little and all the bigger ones for big families.  After she got it she liked it so well that I bought one for myself and it works perfectly.  I think the size for a small family and the ease of cleaning are the real selling points for me

October 11, 2003 ++  Le Creuset Stoneware 9 Inch Square Baking Dish, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I own many items from the Le Creuset stoneware collection, and I must say that they are all of superb quality.  This square pan  is perfect for baking and serving my favorite side dishes and desserts.  I have been impressed over and over again at how non stick the surface of this bakeware is.  Everything I have put into Le Creuset bakeware   brownies, casseroles, refried beans, etc.   has come clean with zero elbow grease.  In fact, the dishwasher usually gets them sparkling clean without my help!  I highly recommend this product as well as everything else from this line 
March 20, 2002 ++  Rowenta DM 990 Ultra Professional Iron: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is my third Rowenta iron and they have all served me well, but this is by far the best.  The steam is amazing.

January 2,
 ++  Calphalon Tri Ply Stainless 8 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We have been extremely pleased with our tri ply set we have the 8 pc. set plus a number of extra pieces we've picked up).  They heat evenly; are durable; the long) handles really do stay cool; and clean well.  Our only complaint is that Calphalon doesn't seem to care about minimizing the number of lids necessary for their cookware.  We own only one lid that fits more than one pot/pan the one for the 10 in. pan, 3 qt. saute, 6 qt. stockpot)  and we have 4 other lids which fit only a single pot, some of which are within 1/2 in. of being the same width!  However, we'd still get these pans again in a second, and probably go for the 13 piece set instead of the 8 piece as well 
August 2,
++  Calphalon Tri Ply Stainless 8 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I used to have the Calphalon Commercial Non Stick and I prefer these.  The stainless steel pans seem to heat up faster, are easier to handle and you can put them in the dishwasher although Calphalon prefers you handwash them).  No problems yet and I don't forsee any.  A great purchase

 ++  Panasonic NB G100P S 7.2 Quart Flash Express 1300 Watt Infrared Toaster Oven, Silver: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Having gone through our share of toaster ovens in 22 years of marriage, this is by far the best.

I can't imagine going back to a traditional toaster oven again.

November 9,
 ++  Villaware V2160 UNO ProPress Panini Grill: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The Villaware Panini Grill has proved to be a very useful appliance, so much so that I leave it out on the counter   it's quite attractive, and certainly not an eyesore.  I use it often, for grilled sandwiches, of course, but also for grilled meats and fish.  I would caution users to avoid meat with bones, e.g. lamb chopsyou can't get a good sear when the bone keeps the surface of the meat away from the grill), and to be very careful about timing: things get done twice as fast!  While the cleaning "comb" is useful to get most of the remaining food or fat off the grill, you still need to fold a paper towel and clean each groove separately; much easier to do if the grill is warm not hot).  I haven't tried grilling vegetables, yet, but it should work perfectly on zucchini sliced the long way, or eggplant, or peppers. I am very happy with the quality of this product 
August 30,
 ++  Deni MT48 48 Blade Meat Tenderizer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I'm blown away! With 48 blades, this product really does the job quickly and quietly.  No more BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! echoing off the walls which only produced a flat but still tough piece of meat.  I'd gladly pay twice the cost for the Deni because it works!  It's very sturdy, very sharp and easy to clean in the DW.  I'm using cheaper cuts of meat sucessfully in recipes I had stored away because of toughness or price.  Marinating is faster and more effective, cooking time can be reduced.  Keep it away from kids.  Protect your countertop.  The best kitchen gadget I ever bought!!

 ++  Westinghouse WST1810 SweepEZE Vacuuming Dustbin with Automatic Infrared Technology: Kitchen & Housewares ++  You either "get" this product or you don't.  It's probably my favorite  appliance in my whole house, and I show it off proudly to everyone who  comes over.  When I do, some folks look at me like I'm nuts while others  instantly begin grinning and nodding their heads.  Kindred spirits!)  Here's the deal.  I hate bending over.  I hate getting my hands dirty with  a dustpan.  I don't mind sweeping a room, but for some reason that extra step of scooping up the pile of dirt and dumping it into the trash can  drives me crazy.  More often than not, I'll just sweep the pile into a  corner, prop the broom against the wall over it, and tell myself I'll take  care of it later.  Disgusting, I know, but I'm not exactly known for my housekeeping skills!)  Anway, with the Sweep Eze, all I have to do is sweep the pile under the  electric eye.  Magically, the machine kicks on and sucks it up  without me having to bend over or get my hands dirty or anything.  I love it!  I don't have to empty the canister very often, maybe once a month at most. The only drawback is that it's pretty loud and my family gets mad at me if I don't warn them that I'm about to kick it on.  But as long as I say  "Sweep Eze alert!", they're happy.  And it only stays on for a few seconds anyway.  Some folks don't get it, but for those who do, this product is invaluable. I'm not sure how I ever got along without it

 ++  Hamilton Beach 52654 Blender/Food Processor Combo: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have used different brands of Blenders and Food Processors from various manufacturers in the past, but beleive me or not, this Blender/Food Processor is really the one I am looking for. It has a powerful motor that can easily break ice, plus the Blender jar is made of really thick, unbreakable material, unlike many other Glass Blender jars. One other feature I like about this combo is its wave action technology, which can continuously pull down the mixture in it and this system really works. The Food processor is large enough to chop/mix fruits and vegetables, and above all it saves a lots of space in my kitchen. I have read a lots of bad reviews from many people about other Combos like this, but I don't know what these people are exactly trying to do with a Blender/Food Processor.

 ++  Corelle Just White 34 Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 8: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've owned a couple of sets of Corelle dinnerware through the years and gave both sets away because I used them so long without breaking any pieces) that I grew tired of the pattern. This time I decided I wanted a plain white dinnerwear set for everyday use. When I did an Internet search, this Corelle set came up. I bought it, and I'm very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend it

++  Fiestaware Scarlet 455 2 Quart Serving Bowl: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Let's face it, you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated.  Nice furniture and practical book shelves.  But you do not live alone; there is probably a canine or feline lurking around.  It may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of Garfield on it or some cutesy saying.  But in the long run this durable, multi use, dishwasher safe, bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he/she wants a few laps of water.

November 16,
 ++  Bodum Chambord 3 Cup Coffee Press: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I purchased this press to supplement a larger 8 cup model.   The press allows just under one standard size mug to be filled.  If you also are looking for a mug's worth of coffee, I would recommend purchasing the 4 cup model as that would leave just a bit more room, and keep more of the small grindings in the press, rather than in the bottom of my cup.   Also, it should be noted that Bodum sells the spare parts for this press right here on Amazon, in fact), so if you should break it, a few dollars will get you back in Java!   Another note, some people have mentioned that dumping the grindings proves problematic as you can't just put them down the drain plugs up your trap).  I have found an easy solution in using the plastic and wire mesh grind basket of my last automatic coffee maker as a strainer.  I just pour the bit of water and grinds out of the press and into the basket which I leave in the sink), and allow the water to run off.  Then I pour shake the dry coffee into the trash.  No fuss, and the basket is dishwasher safe for the occasional cleaning

 ++  Bodum Chambord 3 Cup Coffee Press: Kitchen & Housewares ++       For ideal coffee using a French press is the best method.  It takes a bit more time and effort, but results in much better tasting coffee.  This is because due to the lower temperatures and the lack of a paper filter the coffee oils stay in tact.  This adds a lot of flavor to the coffee that is lost otherwise.        As for this French press in particular: size does matter.  If you make enough coffee that you aren't drinking by the single mug then just get a bigger press.  I drink about a pot and half of coffee most week days and find the effort required to use this smaller press a hassle.  As such I just keep this press at home and only use it in the evenings.

 ++  Conair GS11RH Professional Upright Steamer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We love this thing.  The steamer takes up far less room for both storage and use than a regular standing ironing board.  We have a small house and not alot of wiggle room, so space saving is key for us. Also,I hate ironing; sleeves, collars and touchy fabrics can be a bear.  With the steamer I just drag the wand and go, so far easy as pie.  On some types of fabrics or clothing details I can see where a little touch with a traditional iron would be beneficial, but overall we love this thing.  
November 18,
 ++  KitchenAid KCG200MC Model A 9 Coffee Mill, Metallic Chrome: Kitchen & Housewares ++  All Coffee grinders leave a bit of a mess so don't let the comments about stray grinds deter you.   All the reviewers who used flavored beans need to be discounted since that is not recommended.  Others seem to have trouble with the "door" which is really just a deflector for the grind. You get a few grinds on the counter but that is a small price to pay for delicious fresh coffee.  Th A 9 has a strong relatively quiet motor which means it is still loud, but not as loud as most other burr grinders0 and takes up very little counter space. The glass hopper for the beans seals at the top with a scrw on lid.  I love the idea of the measuring cup which saves a lot of time scooping. It eliminates that step...just grind until you have the right amount and dump it into your coffee basket.  Kitchen Aid has a nice Pro model that costs twice as much by why pay more for less

++  Lodge Original Finish 10 1/2 Inch Cast Iron Round Griddle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I'm glad I bought this griddle! I've been stuck with teflon coated nonstick pans for a while, and when I saw such great deals on cast iron pans, I had to buy a few. I ordered the griddle, the ~10" Logic grill pan, and the ~10" skillet. Thankfully all three qualified for free Super Saver shipping, because the cost to ship was more than the cost of the pans themselves! The order was placed late Monday night, and I was promised that my pans would ship by the following Monday. By Wednesday the griddle had arrived, and the grill pan showed up on Friday. Way to go, UPS! It turns out that its good to get these things early, because it takes a few days to get the "natural finish" pans properly seasoned. I think most of the complaints found in user reviews of cast iron cookware could have been avoided entirely had the reviewers simply taken the time to season their pans properly. Food won't stick to a cast iron pan if you've taken the time to season it until it's black and almost totally non stick. It takes some time and paitence, but it's the same way with a good wok: you get out of it what you put into it, and this certainly reflects in one's cooking. Iif you're going to buy one of these pans, DO YOUR HOMEWORK! Ask Google about cast iron seasoning tips and instructions and you too can have an awesome cast iron pan. If you want to save some time, just buy the Logic line of pans, because saving the effort of seasoning is probably worth the massive price increase the logic griddle is nearly double the price of the original). Keep in mind that you will eventually have to re season the pan, but hopefully not for a while we'll see how the grill pan turns out).  I agree with some of the other reviews, the handle could stand to be made a little longer. I am a pretty physically fit chef, and I still find the griddle to be pretty hefty. A little extra ease of carrying a heavy piece of what's usually very hot iron would be great. I've found that grabbing it with a folded cotton natural fibers don't melt!) towl helps, or if you're serious about using cast iron and you like to sear meat on it) you should invest in a pair of welder's gloves or something equally thick and heavy and fireproof.  This morning I pulled the griddle out of the oven where it had spent the past few days being alternately heated, rubbed down with peanut oil, and cooled; and I heated it up and made pancakes. You have not LIVED until you eat pancakes cooked on a hot cast iron surface. Teflon coated pans simply cannot compare. I can't wait to try making grilled cheese sandwiches, omelettes, and hashed browns on this griddle. With any luck, this will be the last griddle I ever need to buy and hopefully the griddle my grandchildren won't have to buy)

The colors are great and the designs are whimsical. I bought two sets in different colors and mix and match which makes the eating experience even more fun. I want to start collecting all the fun serving pieces too. The only thing I didn't like was taking stickers off each piece in the box. That always makes me crazy, it should be against the law to put stickers on dishes

 ++  T Fal TT7061002 Avante Deluxe 2 Slice Toaster, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The angled slots are useful and easier than top loaders.  The right pull pushes the bread up once toasted, I love this feature.  The bagel toaster is handy as is the stop button.  All of the buttons and pulls are easy and intuitively obvious, you don't need a degree to operate it.  It looks interesting on my counter since it doesn't look like the typical toaster.  I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that a large slice of bread doesn't fit all the way in, the slots could have been a  bit larger.  They are wide enough for fat bread.  I really like this toaster so far.

They are heavy duty and will last for a long time. I do alot of baking and need to freguently replace them. They  heat evenly to prevent burning. The extra large size cuts my time in half so I can spend more time enjoying the end results with my family. The silverstone coating makes clean up a breeze. They are alittle heavy so they are not the best if you want those little hands to help in the baking. These pans are a must have for all

 ++  Senseo HD7810/65 Single Serve Coffee Machine, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This machine turns coffee into a near religeous experience!  Every cup has a perfect crema head, is absolutely fresh, piping hot, rich and strong   and it's SO fast!  Anyone who doesn't like this coffee maker has to be:   1)  Using the machine incorrectly most of the criticisms I've read reveal the real culprit is "pilot error")   2)  Using bad coffee, or 3)  Just not a coffee lover!  I have been responsible for the sale of at least 25 of these machines, simply by serving its coffee to family, friends and collegues   everyone rushes out to buy one for themselves.  Granted, I use great coffee:  Java One's French Roast.  Look for a retailer on line.)    My friends have abandoned Starbacks, now that they can make this!  So don't let the critics scare you   this is the BEST thing to happen to coffee since the blessed bean was discovered.    Come over   I'll make you a cup and all arguments will be settled

++  KitchenAid KHB300WH Hand Blender, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I learned a long time ago, if you go KitchenAid, you go for life. They make the highest quality, longest life products I have ever seen. This hand mixer is the third of its kind I've owned. I've had two of the Braun models and they died out after about a year of average use. I finally got the KitchenAid and it has been going strong for a few years now. I really like having the ability to go down to the bottom of a large pot, a full 8". Even though it is of substantial weight, it fits your hand like a glove. I found it far superior to the Braun, as a matter of fact, it doesn't even compare. The plastic cup with lid makes an excellent accessory since you can mix and store without wasting time. The chopper is the most efficient I have seen, does a better job that a food processor. I especially like the multi speed dial. It goes from 1 to 9 so it has the power you need, when you need it. Egg white or whip cream doesn't even challenge it, the whipping attachment makes sure of that.  This baby  handles like a pro. There are times when you don't need the big mixer and the immersion blender really fills in nicely. You won't be disappointed with the quality, power or its sleek look

++  Le Creuset 11 3/4 Inch Iron Handle Skillet, Dune: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Cooks evenly as all get out, cleans up fine in the dishwasher, and the non stick coating seems to work just fine, but the thing weighs more than my Grandpa's old blue Buick!    It does have the extra little handle on the far side to make it easier to pick up with two hands, so it is manageable.  But it is heavy.  And the handle gets HOT.  So, if you want a great pan and are willing to put up with the weight, hot handle, pick one up when it's on sale and you'l be a happy cook

++  Le Creuset Stoneware 12 1/2  Inch Rectangular Dish, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I'm a true Longaberger fan, but since they're getting out of control on their prices lately, I thought I'd try something else.  This piece by far is the ONLY piece of pottery that I've found that can stand up to Longaberger's quality.  This dish cleans beautifully and holds a nice sized lasagna.  I'm very, very happy with it and only wish I'd found the Le Creuset brand before now.  Grab this dish   it will quickly become your favorite!  I love the color

This means I wait until I absolutely have to use the vacuum and the house is a mess.  This thing is so light and convenient that I pull it out whenever there is a mess and I don't hate doing it.  I have had it for about 3 months now and the battery is great.  In fact I keep forgetting to plug it back in and it still is always ready for me.  It works great on my wood floor and area rugs.

They've seen constant use and are still razor sharp.  It's been a real revelation to me: So this is what good kitchen knives are like, and this is why they cost more than the lightweight stuff!   I've never had a genuinely good chef's knife, paring knife, etc. But when I'm ready to get a serious set, I know exactly what brand I'll buy

That way you could pour the amount you need and pre warm the milk in the pitcher prior to frothing, achieving better & faster & more convenient results

++  Zyliss Easy Spin Salad Spinner with GlideWheel Motion Transparent): Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is my favorite salad spinner, and I've tried several over the last couple years.  It dries my lettuce very well, and has some useful features that I haven't seen in other spinners.  Like the old Zyliss spinner, you pull on a handle to spin the basket.  But with this one the more you pull, the faster it spins, kind of like revving up a top or something.   It spins much faster than those 'crank' spinners or the 'push down' type  and faster spinning means more water off your veggies.  As for the new features, here are my top five:   1) The lid is clear, so you can see the veggies spinning around in there and make sure you're not overfilling the spinner, the lettuce isnt bunching up in one corner, etc. OK, it's also just mesmerizing to watch your food spin round and round.  Kind of like watching your clothes roll around in the dryer.  2) There is a brake! So after you've whipped  your veggies into a frenzy, you can slam them to a stop  which also helps get more water off.  This works better on the small sized spinner, since there is less weight to stop, but even on the big spinner it works very well.  I have seen a brake on another spinner, but this one works much better.  3) The cord pulls itself back in  and gently: I disliked how the old 'string' spinners would yank on your arm, and if you didn't respond just right the string wouldn't pull in at all: it ends up just sitting there in a pile.  You'd have to take the lid off and wind it up yourself!  This new design winds the cord up every time.  4) The basket is smooth on the inside  that's something I defintely have not seen before.  It's a subtle feature, but very helpful: it helps make sure little bits of your lettuce dont get stuck in the basket when you're cleaning it out.  5) You can stack things on top of it, both in the fridge and in the cupboard, because the top is mostly flat.  The handle even sits in its own little pocket in the lid so that it's not in the way.  In my house fridge space is valuable and I appreciate being able to stack this spinner like I do with my tupperware.  So, overall I am impressed with this spinner so impressed that I've also given it as a gift!).  It does its job very well and has thoughtful extra features which make it more helpful around the kitchen

 ++  Calphalon Tri Ply Stainless 8 Inch Nonstick Omelet Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I picked this up on a special promotion for ~$20, and for that price it is unbeatable.  Has held up for years of regular use & dishwasher cleaning.  Be sure to get some soft spatulas with your first non stick pan purchase... 
June 14, 2002 ++  Calphalon Tri Ply Stainless 8 Inch Nonstick Omelet Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Well, "um" My dad has my first Calphalon pan. He stole it from me. ha, ha...He loves it to cook my mom breakfast.   So, I needed a new one.   This pan has a triple coated nonstick interior   nothing sticks, it just slips around.   Trust me, this is important when frying eggs.   There is also a certain sound that seems to be unique to these pans. The food not only cooks well, it sounds good while it is cooking. Yeah, that sounds strange, but you will see what I mean. These pans just have a touch of class to them that is unequalled.   The tri ply stainless construction includes an aluminum core. It is meticulously crafted and the pan sits flat and doesn't move, even on the flat cooktops. The heat distribution is great.   Flared Rim and sloped sides perfect for omelets or sauting  Stay Cool Handle   very impressive, didn't even get warm 100% dishwasher safe  This pan is also oven safe to 450 degrees, however they don't recommend you use this for broiler use as it will damage the nonstick surface of the pan.   I was skeptical because on a flat cooking surface, many pans will actually start spinning. This pan just sat there and that was impressive.   The base is completely flat and that is the beauty. You would be amazed at how many pans are not completely flat.   Covered by a lifetime Warranty so they will repair or replace any item that is found to be defective.   The Nonstick Calphalon Cookware is a real favorite for frying because nothing sticks!   Made this cook smile!  ~TheRebeccaReview.com

 ++  KitchenAid Silicone 6 in 1 Loaf Pan, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  If you like to bake this is a nice product to have in your arsenal of tools.  I bake whole grain muffins and breads every week and find this pan to be extremely useful.    The breads that I have made released easily after they had cooled.  I find it best to place this pan on a cooling rack for about an hour before removing the bread from the pans.  If you do this it releases completely.  If the bread is still warm when you try to remove it, it might not come out in one piece.  I have found that it is best to put this pan on a half sheet pan prior to filling it with dough or batter.  If you try to carry it to the oven without a pan underneath it, it is not very steady.  If you don't have other silicone bakeware you are unfamiliar with the nicest feature of this product.  You can squish it up in a ball to store it, and bounces back to its original shape when you need it.  My only complaint about this pan is that the bread does not brown as well on the bottom as sides as it does in a metal pan.  But, being able to make 6 medium sized loaves at one time more than makes up for decrease in browning. 
October 3, 2003 ++  Le Creuset 6 3/4 Quart Oval French Oven, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've made everything from braised short ribs to homemade Mole in this and I can truly say it is fabulous.

December 22, 
++  Emerilware Stainless 1 Quart Saucier: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Worked very well when whipping up a roux. The heavy disc bottom did a good job of evenly distributing heat and didn't scorch. The rounded sides meant that I had no problem getting a whisk into the sides of the pan. Cleaned up easily and looks really nice. Whoever designed this stuff got the shape and materials right; it is very aesthetically pleasing.  The main downside is that at 1 quart, it is not as useful if you need to cook for more than 2 4 people.  Note to the person who had the pan discolor: simply sprinkle a little bit of "Barkeeper's Friend" in the pan and rub with a damp sponge. I find this cleaner shines up all my stainless steel to like new condition with no scrubbing or scratching. It also works to keep the copper banding looking shiny

 ++  Pyrex 6 Ounce Glass Custard Cup, Set of 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought a dozen of these from another retailer at half price) and I love them! They are perfect for everything that requires a small size container.  I use the cups to beat two eggs, melt butter, heat up baby food never heat food in any plastic), to serve ketchup or other condiments, store a small amount of leftovers, etc. By using the appropriately sized cup, I save a lot of space in both the fridge and the dishwasher.  I recommend these highly 
August 28,
 ++  Pyrex 6 Ounce Glass Custard Cup, Set of 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  ... and I don't even make Custard! LOL  I just love these for small servings of ice cream, fruit, side dishes, etc.  They are great with meals for anything that you don't want to mix with the other foods on your plate.  They are perfect for snacks and desserts.  They are great for things such as pickles, olives, chopped onions, relish, dips, etc. on a casual buffet or picnic table.  They also work well for pre portioning ingredients when making a complicated recipe or allowing younger kids to cook with you.  The typical Pyrex glass which is thick and a bit heavy is perfect for my family because it holds up to less than gentle everyday use.  I still want my children to learn to be careful with china and glassware, but I see no reason to be too 'precious' about everday dishware 
July 7,
 ++  Pyrex 6 Ounce Glass Custard Cup, Set of 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++   I bought two sets of four bowls to complement my nice set of everyday dishes for times when you want just a little bit of something   like a little yogurt, or some granola, some fresh raspberries   and we use them all the time.  I agree with a previous reviewer that they would be wonderful for food prep.  They are not thin, as a previous reviewer has noted.  They are not thick or bulky either, though, just perfect.  They seem like they will last a long time and wear quite well.  They almost look, well...elegant, which seems kind of cool for just Pyrex and for the price.    The bowls come well packaged, and although the price is very low, they definitely don't seem cheaply made.  I haven't seen them in stores, either.  Great buy!

 ++  George Foreman GGR50B Indoor/Outdoor Grill: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Lots of reviews already, so let's not waste your time:  Pros:   easy to setup no waiting for charcoal or having to buy propane)   easy to clean   practical. U can use it indoor/outdoor   No flames, so it's quite hard to actually burn the food  Cons:   Doesn't cook the food 100% evenly. Noticed that the area around the thermostat is hotter. Not by much though, but you can notice the grill marks on the food stronger when near the thermostat   Doesn't get really really hot. If you're trying to cook Brazilian style large chunk of meat), it might not work out. However, it's great if you cut it into smaller chunks of meat.  Overall: I love this so much that some days I use this for lunch and for dinner. There are no pans to clean. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because it's not even throughout the whole plate.

The one small criticism that I have is that the buttons are too easily pushed, and I can't stick it in my pocket without stopping it or changing the setting somehow.  Other than that, it's ALL good.. 
August 12,
++  Component Design TM15 Extra Large Big Digit Timer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this timer, because my husband wanted one similar to the one his mom had, with the big display and the simple, three button operation. This particular timer was better priced than most I looked at, and I liked the extra large display. I have been very happy with it. The buttons don't stick like other timers I have used. I like the way the memory feature works, and the bonus feature that it can count up is also nice

 ++  Honeywell HFD 120 Tower HEPA Air Purifier with Permanent IFD Filter: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Had this on my Amazon wish list, but then came across it for the same price at a Target store and bought it sorry Amazon). And I really am pleased so far. My toddler has allergies and his allergist had recommended an air purifier for his room. We did lots of research in looking for the right one that was still affordable. I really like that this one has washable filters. Lots of $$$ savings there. Since getting this, my son has had fewer runny noses and no severe allergy symptons. We've even been able to drop two of his three allergy meds     not sure yet though if this is due to the seasons, or perhaps we were possibly over medicating him before, or if this thing really does work that kind of miracle. Either way, fewer snotty noses makes me happy. In regard to the concerns over noise, this one is fairly quiet. I keep it on low pretty much all the time and it is hardly noticeable. My son has no problem sleeping with it running in the same room. The oscillating feature is nice and it has a small nightlight on it that comes in handy. I would definitely recommend the Honeywell HFD 120.

 ++  DeLonghi DFH132 SafeHeat Fan Heater: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this heater three years ago based on the good reviews and cheap price.  I expected it to get me through that winter only.  I have used this thing just about daily for the past three years, heat in fall/winter and fan in summer.  It still works quite well and seems ready for the upcoming winter.  The only problem I am beginning to notice now is that the on/off/heat control wheel is starting to become loose.  Otherwise it does a great job for the intended task and has already lasted longer than anticipated.  The thermostat on it is finicky and takes a little playing around with it to do basically what you want but the heat does cycle on/off more or less appropriately.  I'd give 5 stars if the thermostat was perfect but it is what it is and that is good enough.  I just bought two more, my old one will go to the garage for duty there until it eventually fails.  A good, solid product for a very good price 
October 8,
 ++  DeLonghi DFH132 SafeHeat Fan Heater: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Best 20$ I've ever spent. It does have some flaws as stated previously in other reviews, the knobs are hard to read but I've found that I use it so much that I really don't need to be able to see it anymore. The thermometer seems stable, I never have a problem with it getting too hot in the winter, and it manages to heat my efficiency apartment very well. The cord is 'regular' length so it's not tiny and I don't need an extension cord. Over all on a students budget I've definitely found a winner

++  BonJour Cookie Factory: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've had another press for many years, but I couldn't get to it and had cravings for some Spritz cookies. So... I went out and bought this cookie press and to my amazement was very impressed with all the additional accessories it came with. The press worked beautifully I've only used the small barrel so far.) I was concerned that it was battery operated, my last one was a plug in model. But it is nice not to be limited to working near a plug. We had no problems with the unit, it worked quite nicely. I'm looking forward to trying out some of the accessory attachments in the future. I would definitely recommend this press to anyone looking to buy a cookie press

 ++  Lello 4070 Gelato Junior: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This product works wonders! I am big into making my own flavors, and making healthier than store bought versions.  This machine is great for that! It isn't loud at all, definately a big upgrade from the salt and ice mixer I used to have that could wake up the dead.  The fact that you just pop your ingredients in the canister and stick it in is amazing, no messy clean up whatsoever, or need for trips to the store for ice/salt.  The only slight disadvantage is that if you want to add toppings that spread throughout, you need to add it after its almost at icecream consistency and for that you have to pop off the top theres no slide window to add through while its mixing).   But even doing that extra step is simple after 30 min's of churning.  Soft ice cream DEFINATELY never takes longer than 45, usually 37 40, and hard is about 45 48 min.    Buy it and Enjoy!!

 ++  Pfaltzgraff Pistoulet Teapot: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Darling tea pot.  Beautiful colors!  Serves several people.  Just lovely 
September 25,
++  Mission End Table: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The table comes unassembled, but assembly is easy. You will need a large phillips and medium sized phillips screwdrivers. Also the supports on the side for the top will need to be driven on using a hammer, or large chunk of scrap wood. The fit on mine was too tight to be simply slid on. Construction is the cam type that is popular now. All pieces are adequately labled, and small hardware comes nicely packaged; the most convenient I have ever seen. There is an error in the assembly documentation. There are two pieces 1B and 1C, the table sides) which are as far as I can tell are identical. After hardware is installed as indicated on pabe 6 of 13 there is a difference. The two sides are mirror images. On the following page part 1C is shown but labled 1B. This error did not cause me a problem during assembly. The intent was clear to me.  The looks are good. It looks a little clunky to achieve an excellent rating from me. A little milling would help a lot on the drawer face

 ++  Kuhn Rikon 2360 Heart Spring Whisk 10 Inch: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We've gotten into homemade custard based ice cream and that means careful stirring to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot. The design of the working end of the whisk allows the head to reach every bit of the pot but without my having to twist my stirring arm into a knot. Since the head is hinged, it lies flat in a drawer which is a good thing, too

 ++  Cuisinart Everyday Stainless 2 1/2 Quart Tea Kettle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This kettle is very stylish with modern detailing.  The removable whistle and stay cool handle are added pluses.  Its smooth lines make it very easy to clean, and its contemporary shape makes it especially attractive 
March 13, 2003 ++  Cuisinart Everyday Stainless 2 1/2 Quart Tea Kettle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love this tea kettle.  It not only looks great but is of heavy duty construction unlike those $10 aluminum throw aways.  Since I am only an occasional tea drinker, I tend to leave water in the kettle and move it to hot burners when cooling I have cast iron elements/electric oven so burners stay hot for awhile after use).  Other tea kettles create rusty water, since water remains in the kettle.  Not this one!  It boils water rapidly and is great looking on the stove.  My handle does not get hot and, like I said, I have cast iron elements which really heat up and remain hot.  I do agree that you cannot take the whistle off without an oven mit.  That's the only flaw; they should have made the whistle heat resistant like the handle

 ++  Cuisinart Chef's Classic Non Stick Bakeware 14 Inch Pizza Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I add lots of cheese to my pizzas and it tends to get all over the pan.  With other pans, the cheese sticks and I have to pry the pizza off with a spatula. BUT NOT THIS ONE!!  It just slides right off with one shake.  My party pizzas come out crisp and heated evenly.  Also, I have cut my pizzas on this pan and there was barely a scratch on it.  Very heavyweight with no warping.  What a buy!

I am now so protective of my sheets, not allowing my husband or children anywhere near them with dirty hands or food!  I am going to get an extra set just in case something happens to this set.  I would highly recommend buying these and I am very picky

Easy to clean, both inside and out. One expects easy cleaning of non stick interior, but the stainless steel outside comes clean with nothing more than hot, soapy water. The thick aluminum exterior bottom spreads heat evenly. I am impressed by the non stick coating that seems impervious to ordinary wear, but will reserve judgment on that point for the one year anniversary of my purchase

To those who are disappointed that your yogurt may not be as thick as commercial yogurt, please remember that most brands add gelatin as a thickener, so naturally your yogurt wouldn't be that thick

++  Simply Calphalon Nonstick Aluminum 5 Quart Saut? Pan with Cover: Kitchen & Housewares ++   I Love this pan and Size.  I wasn't going to buy this pan at first, cause it was the "Simply", But I'm not sorry at all...    I have alot of Calphalon Commercial at least 20), and yes it's thicker, But I think this cooks very well.  Being that this is abit lighter, I find when its filled up, its heavy enough for me, and easyier to handle.  The price is also alot less then the Calphalon Commercial. Since you most likely would not use this pan everyday, I would think you would not need a lifetime warentee like the Commercial gives you , if you use it the right way.    I have sauted hamburger meat,onions, peppers ect. emptyed the fat off, added sauses, and continued cooking everything together, then puting this into the oven to finish it off.. Never a problem.    I have used this for making Large Egg Omelets, the cheese has never stuck.  Use it for fryed potatoes with low fat cheese, and I don't need to use alot of oil, The nonstick works fine.  I have used this for sauteing Pasta with sauses..    This is a large size, so you can put alot into this and have left overs.  You can make pancakes, frenched toast, I would think anything you want.. I guess what I'm saying is, you can use this size for anything.      I do have the Calphalon Commercial double gridle, but if you don't have room for all the peices that I have, this can cover alot.  I have found this to cook even, and you don't need to turn your stove on high.   This lid seems to fit fine, and its a bit domed. I don't have a problem with it. The sides are stright up, and seems high enough. Lots of flat space in the bottom.    Mine is also made in Ohio, not Japan, but you never know with some peices of Calphalon lately!!     This washes very easy. Never put any Calphalon into the dishwasher, altho this lid you could put into the dishwasher  I don't tho)   I would buy this again...I only paid $42.00 for this, so I did buy two of them, one for a gift.  I don't understand Amazon's priceing , as sometimes the Calphalon Commercial can be less money!! So I would say, take the time and check out your other options, as the Calphalon Commercial has more layers of nonstick and is a higher quality, but don't let that scare you off from buying this one

Similar products at major brick & mortar retailers cost upwards of $100.  My wife and I have been using it for several months now and are both extremely happy with the quality.  It is soft enough to sleep under without a flat sheet or to drape over ourselves while watching a movie on the couch.  Excellent purchase

 ++  Cuisinart ICE 50BC Supreme Ice Cream Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had tried a different ice cream maker that you had to freeze the bowl and returned it. It was too annoying to keep freezing the bowl and it took up too much space in my freezer. I love the cuisinaret Ice 50bc it makes great ice cream. The only negative is the noise and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It is extremely noisy so I pretty much have to leave the room when it's on. I do recommend the Ben and Jerry's ice cream book but wish they would revise it or do another one. See my review on it

 ++  Capresso 555.01 Burr Grinder Select, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  What I like: quantity of beans you can grind before dumping the container, ease of operation  What I don't like: Sort of messy, but this just comes with the whole process of grinding, regardless of brand, hole that ground beans comes out needs cleaning every time  Overall this grinder has been a good buy and I have enjoyed it so much more than my old blade grinder.

 ++  Farberware Classic 3 Quart Saucepan with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have a set of 16 year old Farberware.  I ordered this 3 qt. pan as a replacement  the handle on my old 3 qt. cracked from where the screw hole is.  After I received this beautiful pan, I noticed the limited lifetime guarantee, called the number, and a new handle for my old pan is in the mail to me as we speak.  This 3 qt. pan is even nicer than the pans I bought almost 20 years ago and is higher than the old model with a nicer lid/rolled edges and nicer bottom  and it really is beautiful  very classic styling.  Since I use them so often and new one's so lovely, I will definitely keep the new one even though a replacement handle is on its way.  I also have a 1 qt., 2 qt., 4 qt. pot, 4 qt. dutch oven, 10" skillet and little mini skillet, all of which I use all the time I use at least one or more daily) with no problems.  Very nice, basic cookware at a reasonable, affordable price.  I bought my cookware individually back when I couldn't afford to buy an entire set.  I loved the fact that you could buy a quality pan individually.  BTW, I acquired one of my 4 qt. pots from my grandmother's possessions after who knows how many decades of cooking and it's still in excellent condition.  Also have her double boiler pot.  Even though the screws do loosen, I only have to tighten every few months at most and have never had a screw strip or lost a handle.  I would always buy another Farberware if needed after seeing this new saucepan, would really like to buy a whole set of it, even though I don't really need it!

 ++  Henckels International Everedge 13 Piece Knife Set with Bonus Cheese Knife: Kitchen & Housewares ++  we are very happy with the knives we've purchased.  They are really sharp and do well in the dishwasher 
July 10,
 ++  Henckels International Everedge 13 Piece Knife Set with Bonus Cheese Knife: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have been extremely happy with this set of knives, and for only $40 I believe them to be an excellent value. The blades are sharp and well constructed, and the handles are comfortable and seem durable. The set only comes with two long knives, so you may find yourself washing them while cooking, but we like to use the steak knives for chopping smaller vegetables or trimming meat and have thus rarely found that we are short on knives while cooking. If you're looking to do professional work, these knives probably won't fit your needs, but for an average cook, we use them a lot and haven't found anything they can't handle. Plus, you are getting the set for about $3 per knife, and these knives would run at least $10 to $15 each if purchased individually or at a local retailer.

February 4,
++  Microplane Professional Patented Design Coarse Grater: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is the second Microplane grater that I have purchased actually I purchased the extra coarse version), but the only 1 of the 2 that I would give a 5 rating to. The other grater was from the standard line not the professional line. With many kitchen items there are no significant differences between the two, but in this case it definitely matters!  All Microplane graters use the same basic technology for cutting    technology which was originally developed for the woodworking industry but that has adapted for exceptional service in the kitchen as well. The razor sharp laser cut grating head will make quick & easy work of cheese grating or citrus zesting if you have the proper size). I would suggest when choosing a size of grater that you choose 1 size larger as the sizing tends to run on the small size.  Now, what makes the professional so much better? Well, the standard line has 3 major/minor flaws: 1) the easy grip rubber handle tends to capture water when washed, 2) the plastic molded frame holding the grating surface cracks when washed in the dishwasher, & 3) the head is so incredibly sharp that it must be kept covered, yet there is no easy way to due this except for the original tagboard cover.  The professional version fixes all of these issues. As you can see, the frame and handle are all stainless steel which eliminates issues #1 & #2 and the professional version comes with a nice snap on plastic cover to protect the sharp head surface.  In addition, the rubberized rest on the top of this version can come in very handy.  End result: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

++  Pedrini Gravy Separator: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I make homemade stocks a lot, so having a good separater that can handle a large quantity is really useful. This one works well, and thanks to its design, it cleans up easily in the dishwasher. I have another one with a very thin spout and I have to wash it by hand if I let it sit at all after using it because the dishwasher jets can't seem to get into its narrow opening; it's a real pain. I do not have that problem with this design.    To answer another reviewers' question on plasic vs. glass separaters    I had a glass one and it broke despite being touted as heat resistant glass. When I poured hot gravy into it last Thanksgiving, the glass went flying everywhere as it broke right in my hand! Admittedly, that was an older one and perhaps the newer glass versions are more rugged when it comes to heat. But I just don't have that worry using a plastic one. I'm not an industrial designer, but given the way that plastic is made at exceptionally high heat, I am not aware of any health implications regarding pouring warm liquids into plastic

They managed to last through rain, mud, 80 per hour winds, and even a TORNADO! They still look great)  These chairs were so comfortable and so easy to adjust because of the beans, I would recommend them to everyone..and at their price, it's a HUGE DEAL!

 ++  Rowenta DZ9080 Advancer Iron: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This iron is a technological marvel.  I have just had it for a few days and I have ironed some very difficult, over 100 year, heirloom open embroidered linen.  It was a breeze and the results were truly professional.  The controlls are easy to use, the steam settings excellent.  It just glides over those diffucult spots.  It may be a little pricey, but it is worth every penny.  This is an ideal tool for anyone who sews on home fabrics.  The upright steam feature is a plus.   I was concerned about the weight, but the iron glides so effortlesly that you do not notice the weight.

++  Serta 200 Thread Count Full Luxury Mattress Pad: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was a little dubious about this item.  Some of the reviews indicated that it did not really have deep pockets.  Well, I can tell you that it does.  My mattress is a pillow top measuring in at 16 inches and this mattress pad accomodates it perfectly.  So, do not believe the nay sayers; for the price this is a bargain which should not be passed up

 ++  Waring Pro WMK300 Belgian Waffle Maker, Brushed Stainless: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is in my opinion the best waffle iron you can purchase for home use. There might be a better $600 waffle iron out there, but this is far and away and excellent product. Although I do feel that it's a little flimsy to be called a "professional" product, and seeing as how I've worked in the food industry my whole life, I feel validated in saying that. However, I have used it for a while now, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. From soft to crisp waffles in a short amount of time, any easy to use and clean. My ony complaint is that it's rather large for the size of my kitchen. Excellent waffles! Thick and golden, like in the user submitted photos. I've never had waffles so good, not even in a restaurant. The true Belgian waffle recipes do take a bit of patience and know how, but they're worth the effort. I read some complaints about the timing mechanism, but I find it to be spot on for the most part. Its worth the money 
October 27,
 ++  Waring Pro WMK300 Belgian Waffle Maker, Brushed Stainless: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Ok...the only thing domestic about me is that I live in a house.  Cooking is a necessary evil.  This waffle maker is the best!  We love staying at hotels w/breakfast bars just so we can use the waffle makers!  Two things I have noticed about this appliance...I have 3 kids and a husband that all love the waffles, so when we use it I am making a lot of waffles.  If it starts to appear the waffles are getting more crisp, dial down the heat setting one less than what you are currently set on.  We start out with a "4" setting.  I am in the habit of spritzing the grids EVERY time we bake a waffle.  If you miss between, the waffles don't stick, but it is apparent they don't slip right out as easy.  I have found that a butter flavored cooking spray gives the waffle more of a "restaurant" taste.  We use the box batters...there is no way in hell I would take the time to make the book mix...LOL.  I've used more expensive mixes to store brand mixes $1.99/box) and they all bake up great.    My mom has the same unit and she pretty much echos everything I have said.  They will make extras and freeze them.  We never have extras at our house  LOL!  I have decided to keep my waffler out on the counter, it looks very sleek next to my beautiful staninless Kitchenaid mixer, stainless rice cooker and stainless coffee maker.  And, I admit it, I throw all the mix into the mixer and let the mixer do the job for me.    Clean up is a snap and we have enjoyed having this appliance.  BE SURE TO HAND WASH THE BATTER CUP if you don't want the writing to come off.  I have scratched mine with an ice pick to show the proper level.  Also, I have a small spatula on hand I use to spread the thicker mixes around quickly) if need be.  I also hand wash the tray and just let air dry and wipe up the unit after each use.  I just can't justify taking the entire family out to breakfast for $30 40 when we can make all the goodies at home.  We are also planning a suprise waffle bake for my son's teacher at school for his birthday with my waffler.  I will just pre mix a ton of batter.  We have a family friend who we owe a belated wedding gift to and this is what we are going to get them.  I know they will enjoy it too.  Happy cooking

 ++  Proctor Silex 22452 Cool Touch 2 Slice Toaster, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The Black plastic looks a little odd.  It's not glossy like the picture.  It doesn't look really clean even after you clean it is the only way I can discribe it.  I bought 2 of these for the office to replace our old ones because we burnt a Pop Tart and the rest of the building was less that thrilled that the Fire Department had to respond. This one is suppose to shut down if something gets stuck in it.  Good Idea.  But, the instructions still say not to cook Pop Tarts unattended anyway.  Now they tell us.  There is a toaster with a Pop Tart Logo, the Toastmaster 2035.  If you want a laugh, read the review for that one.  Bottom line, for the money, this toaster works great.  I like the lift feature a lot.  But, I'd buy the white next time

 ++  Proctor Silex 22452 Cool Touch 2 Slice Toaster, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Yes, it's rather uncomely   it's outer casing is obviously plastic and, ours at least, doesn't have that same sheen as the example.  It does look cheap.  THAT being said, it's a VERY functional toaster.  We've had NO problems in six+ months with variability   we know what we're going to get when we drop the lever.  The plastic exterior DOES STAY COOL.  So cool, in fact, that I promise you, you will forget normal toaster safety and burn yourself on the small exposed metal at the top.  Yep, this is a GREAT toatser for someone who wants a functioning toaster and doesn't mind that it's an ugly duckling.  An EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE MONEY

December 9, 2002 ++  Waring FS800 Pro Electric Food Slicer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a great food slicer for the home kitchen, dont compare apples with oranges, this isnt a commercial slicer, but it wasnt advertised as one either) it works great for anything from bacon to tomatos. It has a powerfull motor and a very sharp blade with infinite thinkness adjustments up to a 1/2&quot;, easy to clean and very well built. If you want a good slicer for home use you'll be happy with a waring food slicer

 ++  Farberware Accents 10 1/2 Inch and 12 Inch Deep Skillet Twin Pack, Silver: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I totally love these pans... Next go round I would definately order more of the same,, as I am hard on frying pans, and love these immensel 
February 8,
 ++  Farberware Accents 10 1/2 Inch and 12 Inch Deep Skillet Twin Pack, Silver: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had bought the larger set in BLUE and ordered these pans in BLUE as well. Thinking that they would match the pieces I already owned, I was quite disappointed when I received BLACK instead of the BLUE I ordered. I returned them and Amazon replaced them with another set of BLACK pans. I decided to keep them but am quite upset, with my only alternative being to return them for credit.  Keep in mind that these are NOT the heavy Stainless Steel, but the lighter weight ALUMINUM. You will NOT be able to mistreat these pans by turning the flame up on full. To do so will cause the pans to warp.  The advantage to these pans is that they are LIGHTWEIGHT and easy to handle. I definitely recommend them.   As with all TEFLON coated pans, be sure to use the PLASTIC utensils and NEVER use any metal spoons or turners or you will ruin the Teflon surface. With a little care these will last for years!  TIP: If you're having trouble with the bottom of your pots and pans getting a scorched or burnt look, it's from GREASE. When you wash your pans, make sure all the grease is cleaned off of the outside bottom of the pans

++  SiliconeZone Large Muffin Pan, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought one of these muffin pans because I was excited at the prospect of owning a piece of bakeware whose lining wasn't destroyed by the 3rd time I wanted to use it. For that alone, I would give this item 5 stars.  I am not an experienced baker, but I think that after reading the other review for this item that more balanced comments need to be stated regarding the actual use of this muffin pan.  So here are my comments:  1. You need to use a cookie sheet or something similar) to support the pan since it is flexible.  2. The muffins cook faster than with a metal pan.  3. The muffins seem small if you fill the cups as you would with a metal muffin pan   you can actually fill them up all the way. Recall that I am not an experienced baker; as an engineer I suspect that since the muffins cook differently, i.e. faster, this could be compensated by adjusting the batter in some manner. As far I'm concerned as long as the muffins taste good, it doesn't matter to me.)  4. The coating is not exactly non stick. You do not need to grease the pan, but you do need to be careful when it comes time to remove the muffins. I use the dull side of table knife to separate the muffin sides from the pan while gently pulling the pan). After doing that I put a plate on top of the muffin pan and  hold it against the pan as I invert the pan. All I have to do then is tap the bottoms of the muffin cups to get them out. By my third time doing this I was able to get them all out intact and unscathed.  I am very happy with my muffin pan   it might take a little bit of getting used to for someone used to other pans   but for me, the benefit of not having a cheap non stick coating peeling off of the metal after a year more than compensates for a slight learning curve on the use

++  Omega 8002 Nutrition Center: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought the Omega 8002 Juicer on the recommendation of Dr. Joseph Mercola, a holistic health MD who has a popular newsletter and website. We met him at a health fair, tried vegetable juices including wheatgrass juice) and realized that juicing was a great way to incorporate more vegetables into our diet. I mean, how much broccoli and salad can one person pound down in a day? Not so much.   The Omega 8002 is a single gear machine that turns at a low 80 RPMs, a powerful, slow auger that doesn't heat up the food or cause the juice to foam. This protects the nutritional content of the juice from degradation. In addition, it is "multifunctional"  the juicer can also be employed to make baby food, meat pate, nut butter, or fine ground coffee. The machine is durable, said to be quiet, and has a 10 year guarantee. Sounds good, so we plunked down the cash and got the Omega juicer and set to work.   So, how is it to USE the Omega? Well, it's EASY to put together, though there are quite a few parts and choices to make. Essentially, the steps are:  1. Install the screw drive  the big green plastic spiral, into the plastic housing. 2. Pop a juicing cone a type of sieve) over the screw so it sits into the housing around the screw. This takes a bit of jockeying, but it drops in just fine.  3. Screw on the end cap and nozzle. 4. Mount this housing onto the front of the juicer motor. 5. Add the food platform on top of the feed tube on the housing. 6. Put the two receiving pitchers underneath the housing; one for the pulp, one for the juice.  Now it's ready to start juicing.     1. Cut up your vegetables into strips or pieces that will fit the 1.5 inch diameter of the feed tube. This means if you juice carrots, those tasty large ones need to be halved or quartered lengthwise.   2. Turn on the motor: it has a forward direction to drive the food OUT, and a reverse setting on the toggle switch to move the food back in case of a clog. I've never needed to do this.  3. Push down the vegetables or other foods with the plunger which is included with the juicer. The food feeds along the screw, is broken up, and the juice is forced through the sieve cone.) Out the nozzle comes the pulp. The juice flows out underneath, nearer to the motor.   4. When you are finished, turn off the motor, which is QUITE quiet  nothing like a blender or vacuum cleaner. More like the sound of a pasta maker or food processor, for comparison. Dismantle the machine and wash the parts. A big bottle brush is included for this, very helpful.  5. Cleanup takes about 2 3 minutes and is mainly rinsing. The worse job is the sieve of the cone and even that doesn't take but a moment to swab off some pulp that clings to it. I do this ASAP, as I sip my juice, because letting pulp dry on the machine makes it hard to clean. I then reassemble it right then and there, and it's ready to go again.  The Omega juices kale, which is a rather tough leafy dark green form of cabbage.  We now can do wheatgrass, once we grow some or find a source of flats of it.   Just for grins, I tried the blank cone and did some meat grinding. It makes a fine grind  not something you'd use for hamburger. It would work for soft, somewhat grainy baby food or pate. I did not try making pasta.   How does it compare to spinning cup type models, like the Braun which we previously used for juicing?  1. The spinning cup model Braun) is LOUD, really loud. This is because the cup spins at a high speed and whines as a result. This is typical for the cup type juicer. Sounds like a blender.    2. The cup model cannot juice wheatgrass  the tender stalks of growing wheat or barley that have a lot of antioxidants. It also can't do tough leafy vegetables such as kale.  3. The cup model definitely does not extract as much juice from the vegetables and fruits as compared to the Omega. The pulp in the cup model is a wet slurry. The pulp from the Omega, by contrast, is like slightly moistened sawdust  definitely drier.  In summary, the Omega juicer, while pricier than the typical spinning cup models, is quiet and effective. It gives you the ability to juice and grind things the spinning cup can't handle, like wheatgrass and if you want, meat. It extracts more juice  and at the prices for produce these days, especially if you buy organic produce, this is an important benefit. The juicer is relatively easy to clean and to assemble and use. If you are really serious about drinking vegetable juice or making fresh fruit juices and baby foods, I would say, this is a model to strongly consider over others. The performance and added functionality well repay the higher price

 ++  Mario Batali Small Silicone Spatula, Persimmon: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Perhaps like you, I love silicone.  You can do anything with silicone.  You can fry, poach, make soups, and there is never a worry about heat.  Le Crueset makes fine quality silicone utensils, but their wood is unfinished, so unless you keep them oiled, they will age and spilter.  These you can remove the top if you like but the wooden handles are treated, and are water resistant.    In addition to these being made for the long hall, their shape is unique.  I like that the shape is slightly angled, this makes it easier to run along the edges of a bowl.  I  have been so happy with my purchase of these!  I can't say enough good things about them.  I would recommend these over other manufactors, they are better made, and improve in others weaker areas.  A must have for your kitchen

 ++  SiliconeZone 4 Piece 11 by 15 Inch Non Skid Flexible Cutting Boards: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Love the functionality   being able to separate for different uses esp. meat and that they flex to enable direct frop into the pan. But mine came off color sorta transparent) at the corners and this wasn't a deisgn feaure since there was no pattern in all the four sheets) but still good value   not worth exchanging so I kept them. I guess mine look unique 
August 25,
 ++  SiliconeZone 4 Piece 11 by 15 Inch Non Skid Flexible Cutting Boards: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've had 2 sets of these simple but marvelous mats so far, not only the handiest thing I've bought for my kitchen, but friends keep talking me into giving them one. I only need one or two but one is always on my countertop for various uses the past few years.  I'm a senior lady and disabled, and my time standing in the kitchen is limited so I hate cleaning up messes, picking up dropped stuff on the floor, sterilizing unweildy wood or plastic cutting boards. Mainly love the ease of chopping or slicing vegies on it, folding it over like a funnel and dumping right into a salad bowl or a pan with NO SPILLS, or vegies onto another can't do without item, faithful George Foreman Grill, beside my meat entree. Top down, vegies and meat dinner in 4 minutes.  So simple to just put under the faucet and run hot water over it, or wipe with a little bleach on a sponge. Very few knife marks on mine, but I don't like super sharp knives, and if I seldom have to cut meat I use a scissors and wax paper on the mat to then wrap and freeze pieces. I buy boneless skinless chicken or pork or sirloin chops. The grill gets a once over with a damp paper towel. So simple and time saver, not like cuts on a wooden board which is most unsanitary.   Beyond a slicing surface, great for placing cannisters on to fill with coffee or sugar, salt shakers, or stuff I seem to always have to spill some, shakey hands at 70. Just roll it up, shake in the trash or sink disposal, rinse if necessary and reuse, keeps counter clean and free of stains. I put hot or cold things on it to protect the formica, made a few stains with coffee but cleans with bleach ok, not ruining my counter top. They wear well but at the price, and the work they save they can be tossed for another new one. Best features are flexible enough to roll and empty, easy cleanup forget the broom, and no storage problem in my cramped space   stack them on the counter and peel top one off for next job.  Besides these mats and the elec non stick grill, my micro rice steamer is the third CDW to make food preparation easier than ever in my life. If I spill dry rice filling it, roll and dump in the cooker. I am not kitchen friendly, want to spend as little time on my feet as possible, hate to cook, hate cleaning up, dinner in 6 minutes and I'm done.   So glad to see these are on the web, had a hard time finding more in stores when I want to gift someone. If you want the job done clean and fast, tired of bending picking up rollaway strays off the floor or always between stove and counter narrow space) buy these for a staple in a kitchen, especially for seniors   I've no dishwasher nor disposal I might add. Why in the world would one need a cutting board heat resistant? not for oven or stovetop use. For glue guns and crafts which I also do, put a piece of wax paper over your extra mat if you want to protect a table top, I use one on my desk and serves as a coaster too. I didn't even know about the silicone part, who cares.   Just can't rave enough over these. Saves work, saves time

March 6,
 ++  KitchenAid KFP750WH 700 Watt 12 Cup Food Processor, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've had this processor for about three months. On the first day, I decided to make bread, and the dough blade suddenly stuck to the machine. When I called customer service to help me figure out what I did wrong, they told me that occasionally, this processor's dough blade fuses to the machine. I couldn't even get the containers removed to pack up because everything was stuck together. Fortunately, the customer service rep was really nice and sent out a new one immediately. I received my second new processor, and tried to make cookies. This time, everything worked fine, and the machine is quiet. I can even talk on the phone when using this food processor. I'm just glad that they exchanged the first one so quickly

November 9,
 ++  Magnalite Classic 13 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The solid contruction and well machined lids make these a joy to use.  We didn't want high maint. type of cookware just a high quality, easy to use and maintain product that looks good on the pot racks but cooks well every day.  Boy we are impressed! These cook with even heat and the only negative found was that the lids fit so well you have remember to take them off befor the dish cools or a vacume can form inside requiring reheat to remove the lid. They are easy to clean and a dream to handle 
December 23, 
++  Le Creuset 13 1/4 Quart Round French Oven, Dune: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This monstrous beast is the largest piece of cookware that we own.  Once I manage to wrangle it out from the cupboard and heft it onto the stove, it's many uses range from cooking chickens, small turkeys, and roasts to making potato leek soup.  The beautiful thing is that it really retains heat and cooks items thoroughly and evenly.  The downside is that it can take a while to heat up, especially since it should heat up on a med low setting so as not to burn items and/or damage the porcelain.  Learned this the hard way by turning up my soup to med hi in order to get it boiling more quickly doh!).  Now that we know how to properly use this type of cookware, we are enjoying it much more!  Another clever use of this piece is to incorporate it into your weight lifting routine did I mention this thing is very VERY heavy?).  Now that we have tried the largest, we have begun collecting some of the smaller pots and really enjoying them

 ++  Zojirushi NS PC10 Electric 5 Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  So cliche...but I am forced to learn this lesson OVER & OVER.  I thought to myself $100 for a rice cooker, and bought a $20 one in Chinatown.  It gave me nothing but trouble...Soggy rice, sometimes burned at the bottom, et cetera...  With a friend's suggestion, I made the switch...I decided to invest in this Zojirushi rice cooker and it has been coming out right everytime.  You won't be disappointed

 ++  Presto 04821 Orville Redenbacher Hot Air Corn Popper: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have never had a popcorn maker before and I LOVE it!  I didn't think that it would be any different but its great!  It so much healthier since there is no oil used.  It is fast and not messy at all.  Its cheaper in the long run to becasue a small amount goes a long way.  You can buy a large jar of popcorn for about $5 and its makes ALOT! The only reason I gave it a 4 is becasue I vought this particular one due to the butter melter.  Even when I use soft butter it does not melt all they way.  I just melt it in the microwave while its popping.  NOt a big deal though, I'd buy this maker again 
October 16,
 ++  Presto 04821 Orville Redenbacher Hot Air Corn Popper: Kitchen & Housewares ++  It works great, it's healthier than microwave popcorn, and in the long run it's cheaper too. Pour in half a cup of kernels, plug it in, and within a couple minutes you've got a bowl full of fresh popcorn with only a few unpopped kernels and virtually no cleanup. It's not much louder than most microwave ovens and it's far less likely to burn the popcorn. Only one minor complaint: butter doesn't really melt completely in the cup on top make sure you have melted butter ready to go if you want it). An on/off switch might've been nice but that's not a big deal unless you want to keep it on your countertop permanently. Oh and this product is identical to the Presto PopLite ASIN: B00006IUWA) just with a different label it even says so in the description above), but you get a coupon for 50 cents off Orville's with this one

++  MIU France Silicone Set of Two Spatulas, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  There are all kinds of similar products that claim to be heat resistant to this or that temp. All I can say is these Spatulas are the real deal when it comes to heat resistance and at a great price. I only wish there were a 3rd somewhat smaller blade. However, you can't go wrong with these first two sizes.

 ++  1,200 Thread Count 100% Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set, Cameo: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was originally looking for silk sheets but not the silk sheet price tag.  I'm SO glad I bought these sheets instead.  They are comfy, warm and very smooth to the touch.  They fit my 14" mattress with ease.  I've had them about 2 months now and there are only a few drawbacks that I've noticed... they take _forever_ to dry in my dryer and they might need ironing once dry'ish.  Overall, not worth 600 but if you can catch them on sale you'll be very pleased with the results

 ++  Dyson DC14 Cyclone Animal Upright Vacuum: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My husband has allergies to cat dander, and we have 4 indoor cats. We finally broke down and paid $500+ for this vacuum and replaced our old bag vacuum. I must say, this thing is AMAZING! I cannot say enough good things about this vacuum. The first time we used it in our living room, we emptied the canister 3 times! And I had just vacuumed with my old vacuum the day before.. It is amazing what this machine picks up that other vacuums leave behind. I could find no flaws with this product, other than it would be nice if it were cheaper. :

 ++  Corelle 1057424 Callaway 16 Piece Impressions Dinnerware Set, Service for 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Although I love the patterns and heft of my 2 collections of stoneware, I got very tired of having them chipped and broken by the less "careful" members of my family. Although I've had two sets of Corelle before, and never had any problems with it, I never saw patterns that I could live with for very long. I've gone back to Corelle, and I think this is it for me. True, the plates are very light, but they are so damage resistant  and I can use this pattern for any season 
September 16,
++  Corelle 1057424 Callaway 16 Piece Impressions Dinnerware Set, Service for 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  You could almost use these incredibly practical and beautiful dishes in place of fine china. However, if you look too closely at the ivy print, you'll notice that the "ink dots" are rather large... more like a coarse newspaper photo print than the printed pictures in most magazines. If only they had printed these with higher quality..

I thought it would dull easily or wear down, after all it's only $10, but I was wrong.  Simply fantastic for cutting bread, but also useful for vegetables and other tasks.  The only thing it doesn't cut well is meat

 ++  DeLonghi EAM3200 Magnifica Super Automatic Espresso/Coffee Machine: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am so in love with my new machine.  Many thanks to all the reviewers who made my long search for the perfect espresso machine become a reality.  I received my machine really quickly and that's saying something for someone who loves immediate gratification.  Speaking of gratification, I could not be happier with my choice of an automatic espresso machine.  All the reviews are true. It's perfect, once you read the instructions or perhaps do as I did, get a walk thru from the wonderful folks at DeLonghi customer support, you will be up and running in no time.  You can see that the machine is solidly constructed and with proper care read the instructions) will last a very long time.  The espressos I've made so far are supreme, even my 14 year old loved a weak one I made for him; and it's so easy after set up to use.  It could not be any simpler.  Who would not love this machine?  There was one website that was charging $1200 for the same machine.  I could not believe my eyes.  The only review that troubled me was the one who said the frother was somehow not adequate due to it not swinging far enough away from the machine.  I really could not see what he was talking about.  It has plenty of room for any size cup but you have to remember if you are into the foam it makes very creamy foam) it will increase the volume 2 3 times so you need a large enough container to froth the milk.  But there was no awkwardness or problem at all with using the frother.  They had me worried when I read that but the frother does its thing with total ease.  Even a caveman could do it.  You stick it in the milk and turn the switch and, voila!, it's frothed and container size is only an issue if you are trying to froth in something too small and can't accomodate the foam it creates.  All in All, this is a top notch buy and a guilty pleasure for sure and nothing could be more gratifying then having merchandise that lives up to its promise.  This machine delivers, I love it and so will you 
May 2, 2003 ++  Amco Stainless Steel and Nylon Locking Tongs: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Great item! I have looked for something like this to use in non stick cookware so as not to scratch.

 ++  Vornado 510W Compact Air Circulator: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This tabletop fan is a telling reason why Vornado has been around for a long time.  Great air output, high quality, well built, very quiet on low speed, adjustable so you can tilt it at any angle you want, and just small enough to fit on your desk, table, or in our case, the bathroom counter.  My wife uses this fan to cool off in the bathroom while getting ready in the morning, and it really does the job.  It has a very focused air flow so she can aim it on herself without bothering me.  It's very smooth running, so there's no danger of it vibrating off the counter.  It costs a bit more than the typical portable fan, but then there's nothing more frustrating than having a fan that won't cool you off.  No worries with this one!  The extra money is well spent here.  This fan lives up to the saying, "You get what you pay for" 
February 23,
 ++  Vornado 510W Compact Air Circulator: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We originally bought the product for our toddler's room and then ended up buying a second Vornado for our master bedroom.  This is an excellent buy for several reasons. First, it is sleek and stylish, especially given its neutral color.  Second, it provides a great wind speed given its small size.  Third, it provides a constant soothing wind sound, which is great for drowning out any annoying pheripheral noises.  Lastly, I have not seen the product in a retail store any cheaper than on Amazon.com.  We have had the product over 8 months with nightly use with no sign of defficiency in performance 
August 26,
 ++  Aloha 30&#34; Remote Control Tower Fan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Reliable and functions.  Much less expensive than "ionic breeze" or other yuppie products one might get at the S.I. Has three fan settings and is very quiet.  Doesn't stir up dust and blow it around like a traditional fan does.  Only draw back is that it does not have a filter.

But, that said, this is a gorgeous butter dish and a beautiful addition to your holiday table.  I use mine throughout the holidays and winter, it is just so very pretty and does a great job on keeping butter fresh.  Plus, it's VERY easy to clean don't you love scraping those butter pieces off?) by just popping it on the top shelf of a dishwasher.  Mine has been used for 12 years and still looks new.

++  OXO Good Grips 1059703 1.5 Quart Mixing Bowl: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a very comfortable bowl to use.  Made of sturdy plastic, it is much lighter than glass mixing bowls, which makes it convenient and easy to use. The handle is very ergonomic and comfortable to grip really good when pouring batter into a pan, for instance), and the shape of the bowl itself is perfect for wrapping an arm around for those heavy duty mixing sessions.  The rubber on the bottom keeps the bowl right where you put it   no sliding.  I use this bowl the most of all my mixing bowls and am looking forward to getting a bigger one just like it. Oh, by the way   it's dishwasher safe, too. I've washed mine over and over and it still looks new

January 21, 2001 ++  Hamilton Beach 72610 Fresh Chop 3 Cup Food Chopper: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I ordered this the early part of December, so had it in time for the Christmas season.  I am so very pleasantly surprised about the power and efficiency of this one.  It is small so storage is a breeze, and the capacity of the bowl is just right for any chopping, etc. that you need to do.  This is my &quot;new favorite&quot; appliance 
December 21, 2000 ++  Hamilton Beach 72610 Fresh Chop 3 Cup Food Chopper: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This food chopper is my favorite extra appliance in the kitchen.  For salsas, the low speed lets me keep the ingredients chunky. For sauces, the higher speed can easily puree most ingredients. My favorite item to use it for is onions and it saves alot of tears.  The large bowl not only holds alot, but is also very  easy to clean. I highly recommend this food chopper for frequent or casual dicing cook

 ++  Amco Stainless Steel Cocktail Picks, Set of 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  These are extremely well designed and will be the hit of your party!  I have used these twice at small gatherings and each person who had a martini commented about how great they were and asked where I bought them.  They are easy to clean and easy to store.  I highly recommend them.   Just be sure that your guests do not walk off with them, or even worse toss them in the trash when they are done with their drink.

 ++  Matfer Exopat Nonstick Baking/Roasting Sheet: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was thinking of buying parchment paper before this product caught my eyes.   I took a chance after reviewing others' good reviews on it.  And it was a good buy.  I used it to bake and it's totally non stick.  It's also very easy to clean after use.  If it can be used 5000 times as it claims, I definitely will save a lot compared to buying parchment paper

 ++  Fiesta Cinnabar 495 70 Ounce Casserole with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have the tangerine one and I love it     it's great for using in the microwave to make Rice a Roni and stuff like that.  However, my father ordered the Periwinkle one off of my wish list and it kept getting backordered     for months.  We finally cancelled the order and I got something else from my wish list

++  Progressive Flexible 12  by 15 Inch Chopping Mats 2 Pack): Kitchen & Housewares ++  These are thin, lightweight, flexible mats that are great for chopping things on and then picking up and folding up the edges to pour the food into a pot/pan. This thinness/flexibility has a "downside" too: I do agree with the other reviewers that these mats tend to curl up and not lay flat.  However,they clean up easily, the price is right, and I am happy with my purchase.

They are heavy duty and I put hot items on them with no problems

May 18,
 ++  Capresso 565.04 Infinity Burr Grinder, Brushed Chrome: Kitchen & Housewares ++  After suffering for years with blade grinders and cheaper burr grinders, I decided to take the plunge and get the Capresso Infinity in brushed chrome. This grinder addresses all the problems I had with the lesser machines: it's fairly quiet, free of static, grinds evenly, and is easy to clean although unless you use really oily beans, you shouldn't need to clean it very often).   I don't make espresso, but I've used it to grind coffee for moka pots, French press, and drip coffeemakers, all with great success.  Just a note on its construction: the difference between the chrome versions and the ABS plastic version is more than just the finish or a metal skin. The chrome versions have a "zinc die cast housing," weigh almost twice as much as the ABS plastic version, and are very stable.  Also, as usual, Amazon has inflated the price to make it seem like they're offering us a bargain when they're not. The list price on the manufacturer's website is $139.99, not $190. I got mine locally at Sur la Table

 ++  Old Stone Oven 4467 14 Inch by 16 Inch Baking Stone PIZZA/BREAD): Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was helped in choosing this pizza stone by the hundreds of online reviews and suggestions posted by people from all over. Well, they were all right. Excellent item. I bought two stones and used them simultaneously for the first two homemade pizzas of my life... DELICIOUS! As others have suggested, I never remove the stone from the oven, and lately I just placed a pan containing the dough for an olive focaccia and it came out perfectly done. I am convinced that the stone works its magic also when not used to bake directly on it. I am extremely happy so far and I'd highly recommend this item. Buon Appetito

 ++  Norpro Amber Micro Cover Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  These are excellent!  Instead of reaching for a paper towel, I grab one of these choosing a size that completely covers the top of the item I am microwaving), and then wash it when finished.  I did notice that the smooth side should be on top to prevent it from curling up when it gets hot.  I really like the fact that you can see through it since I couldn't see through paper towels

 ++  OXO Good Grips 1058020 Wooden Turner: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is what I use when making a roux and when I need to break up ground meat while cooking.  It's nice and heavy and feels good in my hand. I have cheaper wooden products and they don't hold up as well as this does.  You can tell the difference between OXO wooden utensils and others because of the quality.  I think you can put it in the dishwasher but I never do. I hand wash it and oil it whenever I oil my cutting board.   I love its rich color.  It's a great product

 ++  Bissell 9400 ProHeat 2X Select Upright Deep Carpet Cleaner: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I wanted to say that this is the Best Cleaner out there as far as Im concerned. Very Easy to Assemble, and Use. Our carpet came out looking like new, all the stains that I have been trying to get out came out with no problem at all. We bought a model home for custom built homes and there was alot of heavy traffic foot) in the house not to mention we have pets in the house. I used the cleaner all through the house 2200 sq ft). It was amaing how this cleaner got everything thing clean.  There was a large bad stain area due to a plate of hot food was dropped and all the oils from the cooking and butter was dumped on the carpet. I tried everything to remove it, nothing would get the stains out. When I used this Steam Cleaner on it, Guess What all the stains had been removed.  I really do think it has something to do with the brush action and the fact that it heats up the water, plus it also gives out equal amount of soap and water.  I would also add that I have used this on our furniture and it worked just as good as it did one the carpet  I have recommended this machine to all my friends, it is worth the money Plus.  I also have a small Steam Cleaner from the same company it is perfect for the Rec Room and pet accidents on the carpet

++  Fiestaware Sunflower 465 9 Inch Lunch Plate: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My wife and I have long been fans of Fiestaware and we have been using many of their pieces for years. Somehow it wasn't until about 2 years ago that we discovered this size. At 9" the lunch plate is perfect for many occasions   especially lunch! smile)   The quality of these plates is very good and this size is very uselul. For some reason these are seldom seen as part of a standard set. We use ours all the time...   Highly Recommended!

++  T Fal Initiatives 9 Piece Total Nonstick Set, Gray: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I got these as part of our wedding registry here on Amazon and with about 2 months of use I am very happy with this set.  More so than any other set of pots/pans that I own.  Here are some pro's: 1   The non stick is truly non stick and so easy to use.  The fact that the outside is non stick also makes cleaning up easy. 2   The handle really does stay cool, even near the edge on gas burners 3   The size of all 9 pieces are very convenient 4   Easy to wash due to non stick and dishwasher safe 5   Thermospots assists in cooking evenly 6   Oven safe  Great price and value

 ++  Fiesta Plum 830 5 Piece Dinnerware Place Setting, Service for 1: Kitchen & Housewares ++  To prevent scratches and chipping and to retain Fiesta's smooth glossy surface, hand wash separately, one piece at a time, in a soft rubber dishpan and stack between paperplates cups between coffee filters).  I do this with all my stoneware and pieces 30 years old still look like new. A friend gave me all her brown dripware Gourmet) from 1969 and the place settings are scratched, pitted and dull from stacking and years of automatic dishwashing.  Mine from the same era are still glossy, mostly scratch free, and certainly not pitted. Also, I don't put my original pieces in my microwave, only hers) because although it may be safe to do so, this can dull a glossy finish.  Re Fiestaware, I remember seeing relatives and neighbors Fiesta cups & plates with chips and always thought them very unattractive and "cheap"  looking, perhaps because of the dull rose, gray, and avacado colors at the time. However,I find most of the colors presently available very bright and pretty and,so far, have bought Heather,Seamist, Scarlett, Tangerine, Turquoise, and yellow. Cobalt, Cinnebar, and Plum are just too dark and dreary for me.  In the store, they are much darker than they look on here. In a library book on fiestaware, they show an earlier cobalt or deep blue color that is very pretty and a real plum color like the fruit) would be bright/pretty, too.

 ++  Fiesta Plum 830 5 Piece Dinnerware Place Setting, Service for 1: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a great set of dinnerware!! After 25 years, my husband and I decided to bring some color into our lives by replacing our wedding gift white Corelle with festive FiestaWare. How lovely to open the cabinets and see color!!! We've mixed colors and have an eight piece display of color. FiestaWare is not only beautiful, but durable.  And it can be put in the dishwasher, microwave, oven and freezer!!! It may cost a bit more than some of the trendy stuff available, but it's adaptability to all uses makes it a fabulous value!!! If you are at all tempted by it     BUY IT!!!! You will LOVE it! Put some color in your life 
November 11,
++  Chicago Metallic Professional Non Stick Perforated Baguette Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have never had any problems using this pan.  The key is to use a recipe for French bread or baguettes, not just any bread recipe.  I use a bread machine dough cycle to prepare the dough, because I'm just not talented at breadmaking.  The French bread recipe in the machine's owner's manual worked fine, and so did a French bread recipe in a bread machine cookbook.  I think other doughs are too soft and get into the holes, as other reviewers have noted.  They didn't prepare the right kind of bread dough.  I'm a whiz at using the bread machine dough cycle, then finishing baking rustic breads in a baguette or French bread pan.  It's no fail!  It makes me look like an expert bread baker.  Trust me, I'm not...if I try making bread without the machine's help, I end up with bricks.  LOL  The Chicago Metallic baguette pan is easy to use and results in a crusty, chewy bread.  Lovely

 ++  RH Forschner Fibrox Chef's Knife 10": Kitchen & Housewares ++  I received this knife as a Christmas present and so far, I am pleased. What struck me first about this knife is how wonderfully sharp it is. I also own a Wusthoff Santoku which I love, too) and this knife was just as sharp right out of the box as the Wusthoff was. It is rather comfortable in the hand and the shape of the blade allows for very smooth rocking and chopping action, which is wonderful when you are chopping vegetables. It is also wonderful for carving meats, with its long sharp blade. The blade is a little on the thin side for my tastes, however, but is certainly functional. The grip is also slightly larger than I would like, making it a bit more cumbersome to hold than my Wusthoff. But these matters are not that important considering the price of this knife. If price were not an issue and I had to choose between a Wusthoff and a Forschner Fibrox, then I would probably choose a Wusthoff. But being that a Wusthoff of this size would be at least $50 more, then price does come to play. If money is no object, then choose the wonderful German steel of a Wusthoff or look into the Japanese steel of a Shun. But if you are like most of us and have to consider price, then I do believe you will be happy with a Forschner Fibrox Chef's Knife. 
May 9, 2002 ++  Le Creuset Small Spoon Spatula, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Yes, the Le Creuset spatulas are wonderful. They look great and are very, very useful. Throw away your old rubber ones which melt and buy one of these. You will never regret it

My pots are now safely organized and my kitchen has more storage space. I wish I had enough room for a second rack.. 
September 16,
 ++  Marineland Emperor 400 Filter System: Kitchen & Housewares ++   I've used a pair of Emperor 400 filters on a 75 gallon tank continuously for the past five years or so. So far, neither has needed attention other than filter changes and recently, new impellers. After five years, the constantly spinning impellers had worn their shafts and bushings to the point where they made a rattley noise, although they still moved water effectively. Replacing the impellers was an easy repair, and restored the unit to almost total silence. The filter may actually now be quieter than when it was new, as there appeared to be a slight design change in the new impellers when compared to the old ones.   I'm still using the original biowheels, with no end in sight. For almost anyone, a single Emperor would provide adequate filtration, however at the time I purchased them, I had seven huge goldfish in the tank, who produced vast quantities of waste matter. Eventually the goldfish grew too large for the tank and were relocated to a pond in the backyard, and the tank was restocked with a variety of colorful tropical fish.   The big selling feature for the Emperor 400 is the dual biowheels, which provides a highly oxygenated living space for beneficial bacteria to colonize. These bacteria help remove some of the waste products which the fish produce, resulting in healthier fish, and extending the time interval between water changes, and thus reducing maintainence of the aquarium. Other filters have alternative methods of providing biological filtration, but the biowheel is so effective that it can keep nitrates at an undetectable level.   These filters are made of a black, slightly flexible plastic which seems to be less brittle than the transparant material used on some other filters. As others have mentioned, each filter has four slots for filter cartridges. And the filter comes with two refillable media containers which can occupy two of those slots, if you choose to use them. Then can hold extra carbon, zeolite, or other material. I have mine filled with porous ceramic noodles.   The Emperor 400 has a control for water volume, so you can turn it down when feeding your fish, preventing all the food from being sucked into the filter. After the fish have finished eating, the volume can be set back to "high", however I have left it in the second slowest postion for weeks at a time, and the fish seemed to be content. I have found that if the volume control is not moved for a long time, it tends to accumulate mineral deposits and become stiff. So, I turn it down every day when feeding, then turn it back up a couple of hours later. Also, if the power is interrupted while water volume is turned down, the filter takes longer to prime itself and begin pumping properly. If power fails when volume is turned up, the filter restarts with no problem when power is restored.     The Emperor 400 comes with a cleaning brush for the spray bars and an extension for the water intake to be used if you have a very deep tank. My own tank is fairly deep, and the extension would bring the intake nearer the bottom, however I don't use the extension, and filtration seem fine.   When setting up an aquarium, it should be born in mind that the closer to a natural habitat you can get, the healthier your fish will be and the less maintainence will be required. My own tank is set up as follows:   Two inches of "Eco Complete planted aquarium substrate" soil purchased in sealed bags at the local store AquariumConnection. The soil is intended for use in aquariums with live plants, which feed on some of the wastes. In the soil, there are approximately 20 Anubis plants scattered around the tank. The fish love to swim between and around the leaves, or hide behind them. From time to time, eggs are laid on the leaves of the plants. The bright green leaves stand out in vivid contrast against the nearly black soil. Two 15 watt fluorescent lights provide illumination to stimulate photsynthesis in the plants.   I strongly recommend that you do NOT use any type of gravel, colored or otherwise, as food falls down into the gravel where fish cannot reach it, and where it rots and fouls the water. If you choose to use gravel, you MUST vacuum the gravel on a weekly basis, and your water still will not be as clean. Gravel equals more work and dirtier water. Sand is better than gravel as food cannot fall down into the sand, but sand still doesn't provide nutrition for live plants. Use Eco Complete soil or something comparable, both you and your fish will be happier.    I also recommend that you do NOT use any type of undergravel filter, as these will also require frequent vacuuming, and eventual dismantling of the tank to clean beneath the filter plate. With the Emperor, you won't need additional filters. And again, undergravel filters equal more work and lower water quality. I NEVER vacuum the soil, and perform a 20% water change every couple of months, usually when I change filter cartridges.    The fish themselves consist of a number of cory catfish, who snuffle around through the soil and pick up whatever falls from above. There are as well golden tetras, cardinal tetras, redline tetras, silver dollars, danios, flying clouds, and mollies, and one otocinclus catfish. Some of the cory catfish are grandfathers several times over, and have grown to a large size in the five years or so they have lived in this tank.   I feed them once each day, around 6:00 pm. Supper consists of several spirulina wafers, plus a pinch of flake food about the size of a nickle, which I crush between my fingers to produce many very fine particles.   To sum up, the Emperor 400 is an efficient and durable filter which will help provide good water quality and healthy fish.

September 14,
++  Cuisinart Chef's Classic 20cm Universal Steamer with Cover: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This steamer fits perfectly on Cuisinart's 4 Qt saucepan.  The lid seals in every bit of steam.  I used to always have to add more water when steaming batches of corn on the cob, but since no steam escapes here, I can make several batches non stop.  I also like the fact that the steamer is wide; that means that the food will cook evenly instead of other steamers where the stuff at the bottom gets overcooked and the stuff at the very top gets undercooked).  I've only used the steamer five or six times but so far, there's practically no sign of dullness or staining   maybe just a little sign of dullness, but I'm more interested in function than appearance.  Washing it immediately will keep it stain free.  Overall, an incredible deal for $20.00

 ++  Jacquard King Comforter Set, Burgundy/Gold: Kitchen & Housewares ++  From the review of this CA King and the review of the King, these comforter's sizes are off only in design. I have a CA King and the CA King actually fits my bed great overall. But the problem is in the main part of the bordered pattern ends too high at the foot of the bed and the beginning of the ruffle part is also now too high up on the foot of the bed, even though the whole thing still fits overall. If I pull the comforter down so that the ruffle part starts at the foot of my bed, it hangs a little low and I have about 10 inches at the head of my bed uncovered. The comforter is absolutely gorgeous and seems to be quality made. I will fill that 10" space with lots of pillows because $60 is an absolute steal!

++  Circulon 2  10 Piece Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have spent thousands of dollar's, On Meyers cookware everthing from KitchenAid, Anolon, Prestige, Faberware, &amp; Circulan, just to name a few. Though Meyers does manufacture very high quality pots &amp; pans and I would recommend them to anyone it's just sad that if you have any problem with them, under warranty, you have to go throught the chain of command, that never gets you anywhere, even if you want to speak with upper management about the rudeness of the customer service department. Their customer service department employees are always very rude and snotty and they act like they are doing you a favor to even talk to you about their products. Don't get me wrong they do make good cookware, probably the best, but you as the consumer are at the mercy of their customer service and their descision or your fait on wheather your life time warranty is honored or not

March 21, 2001 ++  Le Creuset 10 1/4 Inch Square Skillet Grill, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I ordered one of these, after seeing someone use a similar grill pan on a cooking show.  When I received the product, it was superior in quality.  Very heavy and extremely attractive.  I couldn't wait to use it.  I just wanted to get those little grill marks on my food, because I don't own an outdoor grill and I don't like the idea of dealing with mosquitos while grilling outside.  Not only did I get the marks, but I got the burnt grill flavor on my chicken breast, too.   The first night that I used it, I was having a dinner party while cooking.  It performed stellar on the first use.  I used chicken breast strips and noticed that though they seared with that great sound, they were cooking evenly and slowly.  The food didn't burn, but I had to cook it a long time to get the chicken thoroughly done.  The taste was perfect and not burnt or dry at all.  I was so excited that I cooked whole bonely breast two days later and can't wait to grill the shrimp and vegetables this weekend.  Beware though, the thickness of the meat will cause a lengthy grilling time.  So, the house will be full of smoke for the inexperienced cook like me), but the meat will not burn or dry out.  I also purchased the heart shape pot which was great for display of the casserole but the grill pan has me walking on cloud nine.  Matter of fact, I'm eating grilled chicken for lunch right now and it taste great!

It's nice to be able to set the timer for seconds, minutes or hours and also be able to count down or upwards.

The individual boxes themselves were sturdy and have extra cushioning inside, spoon and chopsticks were wrapped separately.   My son is addicted to Ramen Noodles and serving them in these bowls takes it up a notch.  I love the chopsticks that come with the set.  They have  grooves at the tip that serve to hold slippery noodle better than anything I have ever seen.

October 22, 2003 ++  Breville CT40 Classic Four Slice Classic Toaster: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The first thing I noticed about this is just how good it looks.  It really is a showpiece in my kitchen.  The smooth, rounded shape and the shiny chrome finish really make it look fabulous and I leave it out on the counter all the time.  Apart from that, it seems pretty much a normal toaster.  The extra lift feature makes getting small bagels out very easy, and the electronic buttons are handy too.  I like the way it can take four big pieces of bread or bagels without taking up too much room in the kitchen.  5 stars

++  KitchenAid Silicone Turner, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have the four piece set of these silicone utensils, and have been very pleased with them.  They are heat resistant, heavy duty, and look sharp.   They are slightly flexible, but I have not found this to be a problem unless you want to do heavy scraping with the turner.   The best part is the wonderful easy clean properties of the silicone.   My other heat resistant utensils always look icky and need to be scrubbed with a scouring pad to clean the textured finish.   These look great right out of the dishwasher!   I've had them for a year and they've held up great.   The turner has not disintegrated on the edge, either, like many other types do.  The smooth finish allows food to slip right off without sticking as you're cooking

I put it in the dishwasher at least twice and have never had any problems with it. I have no idea what these other reviewers are doing wrong, but I love this filter. I never have grounds in my coffee. There is always a little darker/thicker coffee in the bottom of a good cup of coffee!  As for price, $20 is NOT the actual price for this filter. $10 is the "real" price, so you are not getting a deal on Amazon especially when you add shipping unless you are getting free shipping). I have seen the same $10 filter at Wal Mart, Walgreens, Ace Hardware, and Publix.  Overall, if you enjoy a good cup of coffee and do not want to put the chemicals added to paper filters in your body, buy this coffee filter

 ++  Cake Stand with Cover: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Love this cake plate. Looks like our retro 50s kitchen. Its solid, well formed glass with fluting on the base, a nice touch. And you can't beat the price. Our dinner guests are always excited about desert when they see it displayed so adoringly. I can't think of a single thing bad about it. Well, maybe the cleaning part

 ++  KitchenAid KSM150PSWH Artisan Series 5 Quart Mixer, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've enjoyed mine for 15 years, my mom has enjoyed hers for 36 years, not sure how old my grandma's is, all still run great. Mixes breads, cookies, cakes, pancakes, hamburger and whips cream and egg whites effortlessly. Easy to clean. Some reviews have commented on the weight, my mom has had arthritis for a long time, and she still uses this all the time. Just leave it on your counter, it looks great and you're going to uses it every other day anyway. It is getting to be our standard wedding present and we have never had any complaints. Just feels good to have something so beautiful, reliable, well made and useful sitting handy on the counter

They also maintain a very consistent heat, so that all the cookies on the sheet brown at the same time.

 ++  Farberware Classic 13 Piece Stainless Steel Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Hi, We got this set one month after getting married, and guess what, it is the thing that we always wanted. It gives us the choices in pan sizes. and there are three more mixing bowls which come handy while cooking or storing left overs. The stockpots are wonderful, they are the used  most of the times. The mirror polish is still intact, I think this is a wonderful thing that a newly wed should  have. Its worth the price.  Positive points: Food doesn't stick to the pots/pans You get varieties of sizes. Easy to clean. Looks smart.   Negative points: I feel the handles are little delicate, so we have to give support if the stockpot is completely filled  The mixing bowls are quite thin. Be careful while dumping it into sin

++  Vacu Vin Food Saver, Set of 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I agree with most of the positive reviews of the VacuVin Food Saver set. However, I'd love a larger size  one that could hold at least one pound of ground coffee. I suppose the downside would be that it would take longer to pump the air out of a larger container. But, they're easy to use, look nice, and keep the food fresher longer.   Review update: 05/03/2005 One Star 2 of the containers won't hold a seal any longer. Not recommended for the long term.

++  J.A. Henckels "Classic" Granton Hollow Edge Santoku, 7": Kitchen & Housewares ++  This was my first 'nice' knife when I was taken in by the Santoku craze, and it was certainly a decent choice.  The knife is sharp out of the box, reasonably well balanced, and has pretty good fit/finish.  For the type of person who only buys things like veggies and boneless/skinless chicken, etc., that are largely prepared, this knife will probably fit the bill and allow you finish up small amounts of prep work.  The real drawback is the length.  When you live in the South, you see vidalia onions that are 7" in diameter.  This knife is a bit small to tackle the large veggies.  And don't even think about getting it near hard melons or bone in meats.  Since I got this knife, I've expanded my collection quite a bit, even adding some real Japanese steel.  But this little blade keeps a spot on my magnetic strip, where it comes out for small tasks or when my wife can't get me to relinquish the big blade.  For most cooks, who need a real omni tasker knife, I would look for a 9 10" chef's knife rather than this.

 ++  Corelle Square Rivage 16 Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This listing fails to mention that these dishes are from the Ultra line which are significantly thicker and heavier than just the normal square dishes Corelle has recently released.  This is fabulous because I was concerned that the old Corelle I remember is a bit thin. These carry a 5 year warranty vs. the regular 3 yr.  This pattern is more beautiful in person; the leaves have a great texture to them. The pattern is softer and less "limey" in person in a good way). Don't shy away from Corelle because they aren't known for style I almost did). The durability and beauty of these dishes are unmatched in my opinion.  Purchased two sets for special occassion dinners and everyday use

++  OXO Good Grips 78281 Stainless Serving Spatula: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This cooking/serving stainless steel slotted spoon, like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability, and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design, hefty body, and big, pressure absorbing, non slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers, are the reasons why you'll prefer this product to the more traditional models, as they will allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress related injuries. Its elegant, stylized shape makes it perfect to use either in the kitchen or at the dinner table, and it also comes with an oversized hole at the tip of the handle for easy hanging, and a strong, stout neck guaranteed to be unbendable. Overall, this spoon is perfect to strain vegetables, fruits, shrimp and other foods, and its easy to clean, simple construction and dishwasher safe, hardwearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years. Furthermore, its stainless steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away.  After submitting this product to over three years of normal, everyday use, mine is still just like new.

If you find that you need a zester more than even once a year you should invest in this nifty little product. It boasts solid construction with an easy grip rubberized handle and 5 sharp holes for quick and easy zesting. Very easy to hold and twist when zesting. It even has a little channel knife if you want to do some fancy peeling. This beats the heck out of trying to zest with a cheap grater type device and is vastly superior to trying to zest with the edge of a knife. As I did for years before I learned better) I use lemon and lime zest quite a bit more than the average person and I see no signs that this tool will dull, break, or wear out anytime soon. Highly recommended tool for any active zester. As easy to wash as a fork. Cool

It works great with everyone, and there is no transfer ever.  Browning is even and consistent, and I personally haven't yet had one warp at high temps and I have 4 of them.    They are a standard size, and could be too big for some small ovens.  I ran into this when I needed to visit a friend's home and do baking, and they didn't fit into her wall oven.  Not really Chicago Metallic's fault, just something to watch out for

++  Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless Steel 16 Inch Rectangular Roaster With Rack: Kitchen & Housewares ++  If you have a good cook or chef) in the family, this makes a very impressive gift.  It's a very nice looking pan that stays nice looking.  My only criticism of it is the lack of a non stick interior.  You either will want to line the pan with foil before cooking anything that will generate a mess or where juices might burn, or you'll have to let it soak with a dryer sheet for a while afterwards.  The stainless doesn't retain messes so much as it just takes a bit of effort to get it completely clean.  But it's worth the effort   the pan cooks evenly, the rack is very sturdy.  Worth the money.  Watch out for the handles when they're hot   they don't fold down and it's easy to burn the underside of your arm or hands on them when you're moving it around while hot.

Just last night, I made an impromtu batch of ice cream for a guest, using some over ripe strawberries in the refrigerator. But once we got started we also added a banana and some pecans, first blended in the blender. The end result was scrumptuous.  Ice Cream making can be SOOOO easy with this little gadget. My grandchildren love for me to get it out. What a tasty treat! Who doesn't love home made ice cream, especially when you can see it being made, or better still, help make it.  Keep the inner core in your freezer and the lightweight plastic outer container in a bottom cabinet. No mess, no fuss, no problem.  If you like ice cream and want a simple way of making it, this Donvier is the answer. Buy one. No, buy two and give one away. If I had not gotten mine as a gift, I might never have known the pleasure.  Gail Gupton, Author: 'The 31 Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment', and 'Seekers of Truth'.

And even though it is non stick, I suggest that you  spray it with oil before baking because sometimes it does stick!  It's also  very easy to clean up

 ++  Keurig B 70 Gourmet Single Cup Home Brewing System: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We had been enjoying the whole experience of the Keurig B50, when I got the email and blogsite updates over the past few months that Keurig was promoting a new and improved single cup brewer. I confess   I coveted this new machine in a big way. So when we were the recipients of a bright shiny new B70 last week on our front stoop, it was very much like Christmas for me. My wife just smiled, and the kids gave out a sincere, "Whoa, that's cool!" at our new kitchen friend.  Everything that we liked about the B50 is there for the B70   with the addition of larger cup sizes and the overall look and feel. The coffee just tastes good, first and foremost. I've tasted cups from other single serve brewers, and most of them have been barely more appetizing than generic vending machine drop the cup coffee. From my first experience with the Keurig machines, however, I was amazed how good the brew tasted. The home brewers make a great cup of coffee without having to waste a pot, or lose the coffee all over the counter when the previous machine's brew basket got finicky. The additional My K cup attachments allow for grinding our own beans, too   so as a coffee snob, I'm hooked.  The Platinum B70 adds selection for cup size   right now, I think our best default size is 9.25oz, filling out most travel mugs and our normal in house mugs well without getting watery on the k cups we've tried so far. And it has a larger reservoir for water, meaning we can get more coffee for fewer refills in the kitchen sink. All of these things would be enough, right?  But wow, it is just so cool looking. The blue LED lights that make the water glow on the left, and the blue LCD screen on the right that shows the clock, menu, cup selection, and the chrome fixtures   even the spring loaded holder in the front top of the brewer   all of that combines to make it more than just a good coffee, taking us into the realm of a really cool experience. The kids oooo and aaahhh every time they walk into the evening kitchen, seeing Daddy's glowing blue coffee brewer, just wanting to marvel in its glow.... okay, that's a little too melodramatic, but only slightly.  If you like coffee and spend more than $10 per day, or throw away more than a third of a pot of coffee each morning, or if you enjoy coffee but avoid making it at night because for just one cup that whole pot will go to waste   I think you owe it to yourself to try this brewer out. Not just in the store, but blue and glowing in your own kitchen. Trust me   "Merry Christmas" is a great feeling

++  KitchenAid KHB200OB Hand Blender, Onyx Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I just needed to refute that first review also. This is not a toy, it's not for mixing your ovaltine or slimfast shakes though it will work for SURE). I assume that's what the first reviewer wanted it for. You can get a 19 dollar piece to do that. It's not "about a foot long!" It's 17 inches, and needs to be. It's also not 20 lbs. It's 2 lbs. and it's weight is perfect. It's not a "hand blender" for mixing water. It's an IMMERSION blender for making the thickest of the thick and the creamiest of the creamiest as far as soups go and 50 other uses. I'm a professional chef, this is part of my kit that I don't leave home without. You shouldn't be home without it

++  KitchenAid KHB200OB Hand Blender, Onyx Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I feel obligated to defend this terrific appliance against the "misguided" reviewer who likened it to a jack hammer.  That review gave me pause when I was considering ordering it.  Fortunately I had faith in Amazon's return policy and decided to give it a chance.  It's not at all too heavy or too large.  I'm 5' 3" with small hands and it fits in my hand perfectly.  It really is ergonomically designed.  The power button falls directly under your fingers when you hold it.  You have no need to change your grip until you're through blending  which is next to no time.  It blends thoroughly and efficiently.  It does have enough weight to give you some control.  You wouldn't want something this powerful to be too light  it could just fly out of your grasp.  This feels solid, is very attractive, and also appears to be very well made.  I love it. If you think you might want an immersion blender and if you cook, you do) you'll love it too.    It should be noted that this is also called an immersion blender. I was confused by the two designations  hand blender/immersion blender.  Apparently they are the same thing although listed separately

++  Cuisinart CPT 90 Classic 4 Slice Toaster: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am surprised to see so many negative reviews.  We've had ours for five or six years, use it at least daily, and have been quite satisified with its performance.  It generally toasts the bread evenly, and is consistent from batch to batch and from one day to the next.  It doesn't seem that slow to me, but my expectations may differ from yours.  I agree the 2/4 slice switch is confusing, but we just leave it on the four slice setting.  I also agree it is a bit pricey, but most of our previous toasters only lasted a couple of years and did not perform as consistently.  Perhaps Cuisinart has a quality control problem, but we wouldn't hesitate to buy another one.  Good luck

We froze the pot over night and all day and got it out Sunday evening we poured in our mixture in less than 1/2 hour the alarm sounded, the light turned green, my Daughter gleefuly  pushed the dispense button and out came delicous vanilla softserve. Clean up not so bad either. We love it. Good family project

 ++  Catskill Craftsmen Wood Pastry Board with Baking Graphics: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This was exactly as described.  inexpensive, dense wood cutting board on one side with a nice pastry board on the other.  the wood has an attractive grain that is not out of place on the counter full time. 
August 25,
++  Catskill Craftsmen Wood Pastry Board with Baking Graphics: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Based on the other reviews posted, I purchased this board and am extremely pleased with it. It's nice and big for rolling out all kinds of doughs.  You may have to make room in your cabinet to store it if you don't want it on your counter all the time, but it is worth the trouble.  Also it washes up nicely 
February 24, 
++  Catskill Craftsmen Wood Pastry Board with Baking Graphics: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love having the edge measurements as well as the circular measurments.  I wish I had a cabinet big enough for this wonder tool, but like some of my favorite baking sheets, this will have to live on top of the counter.  After use, it cleans up very nicely, and a coat of mineral oil makes it look like a million dollars.  I'm very satisfied

 ++  Black & Decker AS150 Steam Advantage Iron: Kitchen & Housewares ++  All I needed was an iron to get the wrinkles out of my cloths for school and this did a very good job.

 ++  Roshco Silicone Twelve Cup Muffin Pan with Sled, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We've only used them once, so can't comment on longevity, but our initial use was great.  No odor or fumes as other people have reported.  Even though we forgot to spray it, the muffins came out clean and easy.  The tray is a definite plus!    We got two different Roshco silicon pans, and it does seem that baking times and temps may need to be slightly adjusted and is probably what let to some of the complaints people have listed 
August 31,
 ++  Roshco Silicone Twelve Cup Muffin Pan with Sled, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was pretty hesitant to try a new baking item, but these muffin pans are wonderful! The cleanup is super easy, there is no problem getting the baked item to slip out, and I don't have to worry about rust or tarnish. I would highly recommend this type of new bakeware to anyone who loves to bake, but doesn't love to clean

 ++  Oster 6627 100 Watt Milkshake Drink Mixer, Chrome: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I couldn't disagree more with the previous reviewer.  I purchased the Oster milkshake maker and use it almost everyday.  Three of my sons love their shakes super thick...the Oster had no problem with the amount of ice cream.  My other son watches his weight for wrestling, and I just put low fat milk and a little cocoa and the Oster whips up an incredibly thick drink usually making a glass and a half).  If you put in some crushed ice with milk, it also whips up very thick and frothy.  I am very pleased

 ++  Hoover F7425 900 SteamVac Dual V with SpinScrub Hand Tool: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Great product, does what it's suppose to do.  Brushes are the best.  I have three huskies and it handles the dog hair expertly without clogging up.  For being such a heavy, beastly unit, I cannot understand why the handle is built for such a petite hand.  It should be at least an inch longer so I can actually fit my hand in to it

 ++  Bianca Butterfly Wash Cloth, Yellow: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Especially for your guests. But you could use them in your master bath, of course.

It has a good weight to it so that I am able to cut through bones and large pieces of meat with no trouble at all. And with a name like Henckels you cannot go wrong

++  Hoffritz Stainless Steel Scraper/Chopper: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I used one of these when I was a teenager working in a pizza joint to scrape dough balls off the pan so I could spin pizza's.  Until recently I never knew how versitile these things are.  I use it constantly to keep my cutting board clean, scape rememants of one item off before chopping the next, I use the side to smash garlic cloves, use the rounded handle to smooth surfaces, and more.  This thing is versatile, not just for baking.  For the cheap price of this thing, no kitchen should be without

 ++  Simply Calphalon Nonstick Aluminum 8 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've used these for a while and they still hold up pretty well. They say not to put them in the dishwasher but I have and the non stick is holding up fine. The lids fit nice and tight and the handles don't get too hot   unless you are just taking one of them out of the oven, in that case the handle will be HOT. All said I definately recommend these cause: 1.  There is just the right pans for most situations   who really needs 15 pans? 2.  You get good quality for the money. 3.  The non stick is terrific 
April 3,
++  Simply Calphalon Nonstick Aluminum 8 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My husband and I bought this cookware set when we first got married & I absolutely love it!  It has a nice weight to it & the base & walls are thick, also the lids fit perfectly.  It heats evenly & I never have had any problems with food sticking to them.  Just make sure you don't use metal utensils with these or they may scratch the coating, and the only thing I don't like about these is that the oustide can get stained if you let a pan boil over or put it on a burner that is not clean my husband used to put tortillas & bologna on our coil burner & now I have a stain on the bottom of my frying pan) but I'm sure a little barkeeper's will take it out.  All in all they're great & I highly recommend the

 ++  Cuisinart 4 Piece Stainless Steel Kitchen Tool Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Though these utensils are not recommended for direct use with the Cuisinart pots and pans they will scrape the finish) they have a terrific feel to them.  They are evenly balanced with a useful machanical advantage.  I find them especially functional as serving utensils at the table.   This tool set is very well made, each tool has an excellent finish and "look" to it, the long handles and super excellent size for dishing out your cooking creations makes them a positive addition to any kitchen.  I really use my set and highly recommend this kitchen tool set!

 ++  Oster 5712 Electronic 2 Tier 6.1 Quart Food Steamer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I'm a single 47 year old guy.  I'm not a great cook.  I've lost 25# am now down to 168) and am trying to eat better.  This makes it easy!  No more nuking junk food, or frying food covered in fat, just steam it.  No more worries about burning things the smoke detector used to be my warning that dinner was done).  I bought the Oster 5712 last week.  I've cooked boiled eggs, frozen chicken breast, Contessa stir fry frozen oriental dinners and frozen fish in it so far.  It rocks!  Tonight I'm going to cook diced chicken breast and wild rice with seasonings in it and I'm 99.9% sure it will turn out great even though I've never tried it before.  This baby makes cooking easy.  Cleaning it is also easy.  No burnt food on it, just hot water.  For cleaning it's almost like is has already been soaking in hot dishwater.  Just a bit of soap and spray it off.  As far as price vs functionality this thing is a steal!     Jo

November 4,
 ++  Proctor Silex Food Chopper: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I wish I would have bought one a long time ago. It is so convenient. Easy to clean up. Very nice for grinding nuts in a hurry for baking. Seems powerful enough for everything I have tried it on. You still need to pull out the big food processor for larger amounts because this only holds 1 cup or so. That would be the only negative. Otherwise I love it.  Great product for the price. $14 well spent!! 
February 26,
 ++  Novelty Snowflake 100% Cotton Luxury Flannel Twin Duvet Cover, Brick: Kitchen & Housewares ++  we just bought a new house, and not only is our bedroom the coldest room, we also painted it a blue/grey.  My husband did not want to part ways with our old comforter, even though it didn't match the walls.  This duvet cover was the PERFECT solution.  It is extremely soft and warm, and the "Windstream" colored snowflakes match our walls perfectly.  I may even keep in on the bed in the summer when we have the A/C going in the room

December 15, 2001 ++  OXO Good Grips 27680 5 Piece Seafood Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a very nice seafood set. The OXO brand is always something you can rely on. The only complaint I have about this set is that the cracker is a little bit on the heavy and clunky side

 ++  100% Egyptian Cotton 725 Gram 6 Piece Towel Set, Bluestone: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought these in a few colors at a higher price) about a month ago. They were purchased to replace some designer catalog towels that I mistakenly thought would be of better quality. Well the designer towels shed about 1/2 their heft in my drier.  So here I came to Amazon looking for a better alternative.  I ordered 3 sets of these and am impressed with their drying ability and their feel. The towels are nice and thick and absorbent like a towel should be, right?). The package of six include two sets    making this an even better deal.  I just went back and bought another three sets for use over the holidays with out of town guests. You won't be  sorry with these. I am tossing my old towels and using these sets almost exclusively

++  Delonghi AR1070 Retro Convection Oven with Rotisserie: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Have had this for several weeks. Almost stopped using my stove. Being a bachelor, somewhere I forgot how much better food tastes broiled or on the spit. Have done whole chickens a couple of times, really moist and tender. This is easy to use, and it is a good looking unit. Cooking times are consistent. No problems so far. I have not found the fan to be noisy, perhaps that individual just has a bad unit. My folks sent me some of those big elastic bands to use when you are using the spit. Those work well too

 ++  Proctor Silex 26500 Morning Baker Belgian Waffle Baker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I agree with all of the other good reviews. I received my waffle maker yesterday and made waffles this morning.

September 3,
++  Farberware Classic 5/8 Quart Butter Warmer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have two of these Warmers and use them for much more than butter   especially around the holidays.  They are heavy duty, which you don't see by the pciture, and are also great for melting chocolate, cheese, scalding milk, and much more.  If you need a smaller pan for cooking project, I stongly recommend this one! 
September 3,
++  Royal Albert Old Country Roses 3 Piece Tea Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Pictures on line don't come close to the beauty of the set.  The tea pot is large! The set is worth every penny I paid and then some. I checked other web sites and the price for this set was $150 up to $225. Buy it, you can't find it for less I shopped around prior to making my purchase!    I rate the set a 10+ for the size of the pieces as well as Barrons quick shipping of my purchases.  ALL have arrived fast and in excellent, excellent condition. Barrons does an outstanding job on their packaging to protect the pieces during shipping

 ++  Cuisinart DCG 20N Coffee Bar Coffee Grinder, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I received this grinder as a Christmas gift from my son in law after my cheapo, cheapo grinder went kaput! I am surprised at some of the not so happy reviews because we use this grinder every single day, sometimes twice in one day, and it works really well.   If the grinder is dedicated for coffee or spices, there's no need to clean it like, with water and soap; just tap around the outside canister and all the excess residue falls off the edges into the cup/blade area.   I really like the grinder, and knowing my luck, this Cuisinart will last a long time only because I've had my eye on a Kitchen Aid coffee grinder to match the rest of my appliances) and just happened to get this one as a gift. Oh well! But, the grinder is worth the money, and it does what it's supposed to do. Unless you're the type of person who needs directions on how to breathe, this grinder is a no brainer :

 ++  Dirt Devil 08230 Ultra Power Handheld Vacuum: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had one many years ago and never had a problem. Good suction, maybe a little loud, but I don't care.  I liked it so much I'm trying to get a new one.  I don't recall ever having a problem with it like other reviewers have mentioned    smoking, etc.  It worked well and cleaned well 
September 2,
++  Dirt Devil 08230 Ultra Power Handheld Vacuum: Kitchen & Housewares ++  i bought this after reading many reviews and found that they were all in 2 catagories either you loved it or you hated it. i am no exception i really like it. it works like a dream on plush high pile carpets that you can't really run a regular vacuum cleaner over. i don't have any trouble getting it to pick up dirt. the price was great less than $30) and bags and belts are easy to find and inexpensive. it could have a little more suction in the hose for attachments but it still picks up dirt well. the best use i get out of it  is the roller brush. the roller is very strong and keeps going even when used on deep pile carpets

February 22,
++  Calphalon Contemporary Cutlery Kitchen Shears: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I used to sell cutlery and own a range of knives myself, so I have tried many cutlery products from many different brands. In 2003, I bought these Calphalon Contemporary shears since I did not own a pair of shears. Before I purchased these, I tried a pair of Henckels Twinshear kitchen shears, and felt that they were not as strong and sharp as I would have liked. I was a little worried about the quality of these shears since they were made in China rather than in Germany or Japan, even though newer brands such as Calphalon and Furi are now making far better cutlery than has ever before been made in China. After over a year of using these, I am quite impressed with them. The handles are very comfortable, and the blades are stronger and sharper than the aforementioned Henckels shears. Most impressively, the blades show very little wear, despite the fact I have certainly used them quite often. Also, the handles on these are far better compared to those on the Calphalon Traditional and Stainless shears. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a top quality, reasonably priced set of kitchen shears 
April 18, 2002 ++  All Clad Square Cake Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The price of this pan threw me, but I decided to give it a try since the cookware is so good.  The pan is the best I've ever used.  It doesn't stick, it cleans up quickly, and it's true, you CAN use metal utensils in it.  I've had the pan for almost a year, and it looks, and bakes, as if it's brand new, even though it is used constantly 
December 29, 2002 ++  Fiesta Sunflower 495 70 Ounce Casserole with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Fiestaware is timeless. Classic shape, classic colors, great quality. The finish is lead free. The looks are from a bygone era but hold a charm that makes the transition to current styles. Great gift... can always be used. The only drawback I would say is the colors. Sometimes it is difficult to match colors to other brands of dishes you may already have

++  OXO Good Grips 26681 4 Inch Pizza Wheel: Kitchen & Housewares ++   This is a brilliant device and the Daddy of pizza wheels, all pizza parlours should buy one or two they would save themselves a fortune! One spin across the pizza and it's done! no repeated to and froing or worse, finishing the job with a knife! It does not need sharpening either, just as well cos I am clueless as to how on earth you would do that job! Oxo brands are just really really good so start collecting now 
January 22,
 ++  All Clad Stainless Large Soup Ladle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This All Clad ladle is a beauty you'll wonder how you ever did without. Before I bought this, my drawers held only gravy/sauce ladles. You know, those short little things that'll fall down inside your pot and your soup. Buy one of these and suffer that fate no more! Now that I own this, I truly enjoy preparing big pots of stew or soup. You'll feel like a real chef when you dish up portions to your family or friends. 
December 27,
++  Emerilware Stainless 8 Inch Fry Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I use Calphalon commercial hard anodized and wanted to try out stainless steel.  This pan seemed the ideal way to do it, given the price and the manufacturing pedigree All Clad).  The first time I used it I fried ham and scrambled eggs in it using less than 2 Tbsp of butter.  Very little stuck to it, and clean up was about as easy as a non stick pan.  Use a Dobie pad as recommended and you'll have no problems.  I won't trade my Calphalon for stainless, but having said that, it looks great, heats evenly, and cooks like a champ.  Well worth the $20.  Give it a try and leave the Wear Ever non stick behind 
January 16,
 ++  Soehnle Vera White Digital Food Scale: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The scale I received from Amazon looks the same as the picture for the "Soehnle Vera White Digital Food Scale" but it's a different model. The one I received uses the CR 2430 lithium battery, not four AAs as advertised. Also, the product manual is different. The actual manual's title is "67000   67007 g/oz," not "8122/8123 g/oz." On the bottom of the scale, there is a number similar to Soehnle's product numbers, 812215. But I could not find such a product anywhere.  Fortunately, the maximum weight capacity of this scale is 5000g as advertised. It's actually about 5280g. The unit of measure is in 1g or 0.05oz increments. Weighing items with this scale is very easy. The LCD screen has large 0.5" numbers. It has a 2 minute auto shut off switch, and a supposedly low battery indication.  Overall, this is a very good scale and I recommend it if you're willing to put up with purchasing a lithium battery once in a while

 ++  Cuisinart DLC 2011BCN Prep 11 Plus Food Processor, Brushed Chrome: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have Cuisinart DLC 2011 Prep 11 Plus Food Processor for about a year and i wouldn't even think that i could use it so much. I've got additional discs and i can do anything. It's fast, it's reliable, it's really helpfull. I would probably ish to have a bigger size, but this one is ok and i didn't want to spend more. I've spent the difference in price on discs and discs holder.  P.s. The disc for french fries doesn't work for frech fries, but it cuts real nucely for home fries and soop

++  Cuisinart DLC 2011BCN Prep 11 Plus Food Processor, Brushed Chrome: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love my cuisinart prep 11 plus food processor.  Since I use it for all sorts of cooking, I have purchased all of the disks for it.  I don't want three or four different holders for disks, etc. because I don't have unlimited closet and counter space.  Since they sell a complete set of disks why, oh, why don't they sell a tower small footprint) that will hold all of the attachments.  This is short sighted of them.  I have friends who have the same gripe.  If someone manufactures such a disk holder we would be interested in knowing how to contact that company

 ++  W�sthof Classic 2 Piece Asian Cook's Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  If you prep a lot of fruits and vegetables in your kitchen, this is the set for you.  The Santoku knife is lighter than a standard chef's knife.  But this is what makes it so wonderful on fruits and vegetables.  I have used it to carve prime rib just to see how if worked) and it performed just as well as my chef's knife, except that it is a little smaller.  I find that I use the Santoku 90% of the time in my kitchen.  If you are diminutive female, this knife feels right in the hand since it is a little smaller than a standard chef's knife.  I love the blade on this knife.  It holds an edge much longer than my non Wustof knives.  The paring knife is nothing special.  But it does have the same nice hard blade that is on the Santoku.  You will not be disappointed in this purchase if you love to cook.

 ++  Royal Velvet Signature European White Goose Down King Pillow: Kitchen & Housewares ++  It's a pretty good down pillow. It's well filled and doesn't feel too low to me.  The label on the pillow itself states minimum 75% down, but I couldn't feel any feathers, so the down quality is decent.  The cover is nice and it doesn't smell more then any other new down pillow. The pillow is machine washable, so you can wash it to get rid of smell faster

 ++  Tiara Lace 400 Thread Count Queen Sheet Set, Caf�: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I really love these bed sheets.  From the moment I got them I put them on my king size bed and I almost didn't want to take them off to wash them. They are very comfortable and of a very good quality.  The fitted sheet does have deep pockets indeed so they stay attached to the matress even after several days of use.  I am very pleased with this product

 ++  Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite 1000 Watt Juice Extractor: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My friend Orri suggested the Breville 800JEXL. My husband, who enjoys dishes to cooking, has become the expert juicer. It's definitely worth the extra money if you are serious about juicing. Remember.... If you're in a rush, but want juice, simply wash the breville off and save the soaping for the dishwasher. The clean up is really not bad if you cook and are use to doing dishes. Have fun. Ginge

 ++  Frieling Stainless Steel 35 Ounce French Press: Kitchen & Housewares ++  FABULOUS!!!  I purchased this as a gift for relatives who are very highly educated, worldy, well travelled, serious chefs, who've enjoyed coffee brewed all over the world even Antarctica!).  Needless to say, gift buying for them is tricky!  When they got this, their Bodum decanter had just broken, so the timing was perfect...they love this model! Use it daily!  In fact, they're so impressed, that they now order it from Amazon.com & give it as a wedding gift to newly married couples in their social circle.  Also note, there is a coordinating sugar & creamer set available for purchase that matches perfectly, holds adequate volumes of sugar & cream, & makes a stunning table display.  I already have a few Bodum sets, including the stainless steel insulated models, so I won't need another FP, but I also will give this Frieling model as a wedding/housewarming gift to coffee aficionados.

 ++  Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Infuser Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I like it's size, weight, and the fact that it is clear glass so you can see the tea.  I keep it warm at my desk with the aid of a coffee cup warmer and one cup will last for several hours.  The strainer works flawlessly for me

 ++  Nissan 14 Ounce Leak Proof Insulated Travel Mug: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have four of these mugs.  Pros:   Keeps coffee hot for a very long time when sealed.   Doesn't leak.   Durable.   Carabiner makes it easy to clip onto backpack.  Cons:   A little inconvenient to clean.   Nissan unresponsive about replacement parts.  Tips: Make sure the lid is screwed down snugly, but not too tightly. You want to form a complete seal to prevent leaks and retain heat, but the seal gets tighter as the contents cool and shrink.  Don't fill past the raised metal fill line on the inside of the mug. If you overfill the mug, some liquid will be pushed up into the threads when you screw the lid down, and you won't notice until you tip the mug. It's easier to see the line if you fill it beneath an overhead light.) If you think your mug leaks, you've probably overfilled it.  If you fill it just right, you don't even have to stir your coffee. Just add your sugar, cream, ketchup, or whatever you put in there, seal the lid, and shake the mug to mix it. I've never been able to do this with any other mug).  When you wash the mug, remember to remove and wash the silicone rubber o ring. The lid is hollow and can be pried apart with a spoon for cleaning if some liquid seeps inside.  If you wash the mug in the dishwasher Nissan recommends against this), remove the plastic base before or after) washing to remove the water that collects in there.  If you lose the gasket or cut it on a knife in the dishwasher like I did), I've found these to be suitable inexpensive replacements after a lot of hunting around: 228 Silicone Rubber O Ring 70A Durometer, Burnt Orange, 2 1/4" ID x 2 1/2" OD x 1/8" W, by Small Parts Inc

 ++  Oster 078108 100 000 Hot Water on Demand Pet Washer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Great Product for a good price.  All sent as ordered 
July 27,
 ++  Oster 078108 100 000 Hot Water on Demand Pet Washer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The previous reviewer was correct. This item does not have the pump and hose for using it without a garden hose. I was easily able to order these parts and the clip to hold the pump from the Coleman website. Just look at the hot water on demand there and open the replacement parts link.   Other then that it is still cheaper then Coleman and works very well. This will work great in our off the grid camping adventures. 
January 29, 2003 ++  Emile Henry Couleurs Creamer, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I LOVE THIS PITCHER IT SITS ON MY COUNTER ALL THE TIME.BEATIFUL COBALT BLUE COLOR,WITH WHITE INSIDE,REALLY ADDS SOMETHING TO CREAMERS,WISH ... SOLD THE BIG ONE I WOULD BUY IT IN A HEART BEAT.GREAT FOR SYRUP ALSO 
October 27,
 ++  Capresso 454 CoffeeTEAM S Coffee Maker/Burr Grinder Combination: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We've had this coffee pot for about 3 months and absolutely love it.  Once you learn how everything sits correctly you can have great coffee all the time.  It's great having the coffee already in the pot.  We get about 4 pots of coffee from what is stored.  The only thing I would have liked better was a 12 cup coffee pot.  I sometimes find after we have our coffee in the morning and with my husband taking a thermos has me sometimes having to make another pot.  It's no big deal though because it's so easy.  You'll love it.  
July 26,
 ++  Nutramatic 2X Automatic Feeder: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I purchased this product the day before going on vacation, so i didn't have much time to research.  I've owned it for 28 days, and it's been working fine so far.  I use small pellets, not flakes  so that's all i can rate it for.  It seems to work at the same times every day, and a uniform amount of food appears to drop.  It is not quiet, so if it is used in a bedroom, make sure you adjust your feeding times as not to be disturbed while sleeping.  I acually don't mind knowing when it's running, so if i'm around I can check on it's function. Time will tell if it's a great product  but so far, so good.  I must change my review  I too had one of the battery contacts break off, and the unit became unreliable. I'd often have to remove and replace the batteries to get it to work again. I'd look elsewhere before buying another 
September 21, 2000 ++  Nissan 14 Ounce Stainless Steel Vacuum Commuter Mug: Kitchen & Housewares ++  What I especially appreciate about this mug is that, unlike cheaper stainless steel mugs, this one does not impart a metallic flavor to tea. It really insulates, beverage stays hot for hours while the mug feels cool to the touch. My husband and I each have one. Don't leave home without it 
May 29, 2003 ++  KitchenAid Silicone Spatula Scraper, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  As a long time critic of kitchen tools and ALL Miracle Whip applicators, I was skeptical when I was presented with this device. It uses the same "scraper/spatula" design that has been prevalent in the United States since the release of the Tupperware model R. At first glance I was not impressed with this tool. It was nothing flashy, although I must admit the red color was quite innovative. But, the real test would have to come when I put it into service. She wasn't as stiff as some of the hard plastic models I have tested, but not as floppy as most silicone models I have labored through. I would have to say it was a happy medium. So I dug right in and began making some fried wonton stuffed with Miracle Whip, and I must say this spatula sparkled. Pounds of Miracle Whip got stuffed into this little Asian number, and the spatula never failed. I knock off one point for the simple fact, that they don't offer a Miracle Whip branded version of this spatula. Now that would be really nice. Also, not quite strong enough to be used a tactical weapon, but quite suitable as a disciplinary tool 
February 24,
 ++  VillaWare V2002 UNO  Belgian Waffler   Round: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This one works great.  I had a square krupps waffle maker before and this one is ten times better....cooks better, heats faster, looks better, and the audible ready alert is great.  I saw this one on Good Eats on Food Network, and I am thrilled that I have this one....exactly what I wanted 
November 9,
 ++  Waring Pro MG 800 Professional Meat Grinder, Brushed Stainless Steel: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Until I purchased this meat grinder, I was grinding with a manual one.  It was a chore to set up and clean up.  The Pro MG 800 Professional Meat Grinder made the grinding easy.  It does not have to be clamped on the table.  Ground meat comes out nicely into a bowl underneath.  Easy clean up, fast speed, three blades interchangeable for the grinding.  I am totally happy with the product I purchased.  Also, on top of being an efficient grinder it is very compact that does not take much space for storing.   The advantage of having a grinder is I can grind my preferred cut anytime and know what went into the ground meat 
January 6, 2003 ++  WMF Boston Cocktail Shaker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Tired of those metal cocktail shakers where the top refuses to open when you go to clean it?  The vacuum that occurs with the metal variety has happened to us on every model we've tried.  The Boston Cocktail Shaker does not have this problem.  We had no difficulty whatsoever with a tight seal on the first try and have had no leakage problems.  The only drawback very minor) is that the measurement lines do not go all the way to the bottom of the glass.  So if you're measuring out small quantities of liquor, you still need to use a jigger.  Other than that, it is very easy to use and clean.  Top rating for this bar helper 
July 9, 2000 ++  Lodge Cast Iron Stir Fry/Wok Skillet: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My dad originally bought one of these woks from lodge and we use it for everything. We can brown all sorts of meats for varying dishes. For Stir frying it is incredible, nothing sticks to it and we don't have to  worry about even cooking. I have recently purchased one for myself and I  couldn't be happier with it. At less than 50 is is a great bargain. Another  great use for it is deep frying. It is a tad heavy so do not try to pick it  up and serve because it will very easily slip from your hands. Overall my  favorite cooking tool ever 
November 22,
 ++  Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 12 Inch Everyday Pan with Medium Dome Cover: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought the 14 piece set for my parents and then added this pan to their collection. They just love it.   It is so nice that my mom doesn't even bother to put food in a serving dish, she just sits this pan on the table when we have company. It is so regal and incredibly well made. It always looks beautiful.  The other thing I like is that the handles and bottom of the pan are stamped Cuisinart so everyone knows this is a quality item.   I'm very happy with my purchase 
August 8,
 ++  Vacu Vin Pineapple Easy Slicer, Set of 3: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought 3 of these. They are great. Easy to use, easy to clean and they work. After buying one I ordered 2 more for gifts and both of those people who recieved them also loved them.

April 8, 2002 ++  KitchenAid KBC90N Mixer Bowl Covers for Pivot Head Stand Mixer Bowls, Set of 2: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I like these lid covers as they fit very well.  I have always had a hard time with plastic wrap sticking, or aluminum foil tearing.  I would recommend this if you need to store your recipes for a bit before serving them.  I also like the sturdiness of these lids as it does not allow flavors to mix when you put them in the refrigerator 
August 23, 2000 ++  KitchenAid KBC90N Mixer Bowl Covers for Pivot Head Stand Mixer Bowls, Set of 2: Kitchen & Housewares ++  There isn't much you say about a plasic cover, but I'll try...  These  covers fit securely over the bowl for kepting whatever you're mixing fresh.   You can also store anything in it like it was a tuperware spelling?)  item.  I'd recomend having them around, because you'll use them!  These are  for the 4 1/2 quart bowl and are dishwasher safe 
February 20,
++  Deep Water Bath   Clear): Kitchen & Housewares ++  This thing is wonderful. I've enjoyed one since my first home and it makes a tremendous difference  esp. if you rent and don't have any control over the kind of tub you have. 
August 25,
 ++  Wamsutta 100% Egyptian Cotton Jersey Twin Sheet Set, Celery: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this sheet set almost 5 months ago & they have actually become my favorite sheets.  I have several sets, and many of them were quite exepensive, but i always seem to reach for these sheets.  The only time we use another set is when we are washing these.  They are very soft & stretchy not too stretchy)and wash up so nicethey hold the dryer warmth so well)!  This set has been great during the summer & i think will also be great during the colder months with a heavier blanket.  You couldn't get a better set anywhere near this price! 
January 23,
 ++  Churchill China Brook Blue Tea Pot: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My teapot arrived from Amazon very quickly and I was very pleased with my first purchase. It is just the right size for me as I usually make two or three cups. Even though it could hold more, it is not too large for a smaller amount. The tea does not drip when poured . . . thank goodness! The one I had before consistently dripped so my reason for getting a new one. This one also fits well in my hand, and I love the fact that you can microwave it if you need to heat up a bit. Overall, I would say it is quite lovely and and high quality 
September 23,
++  Churchill China Brook Blue Tea Pot: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Item exactly as promised. Was a gift for Dad's new wife. She was very happy with it 
December 18, 2003 ++  H.A. Mack French Beechwood Mixing Spoon 10 in.: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Even if entering the kitchen gives you hives, this spoon can make it easier. It's balanced, easy to use and easy to clean and store.  It goes from the cooktop to serving in a contemporary fashion...WITHOUT spilling, breaking like some of the el cheapo brands.  If you care for this spoon   it will serve you well for many years.  My first one   I used to death and it died only as a result of an accident with in?) the blender.  Been searching for one ever since to replace   and at this price I am buying several

 ++  Braun WK600 Impressions 7 Cup Electric Kettle, Brushed Stainless Steel: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a great product, not only does it boil water fast, it is easy to fill and use, and pours beautifully 
March 8,
 ++  MIU France Stainless Steel 7 Piece Measuring Cup Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Very nice, beats flimsy plastic. I have broken or otherwise worn out parts of plastic measuring sets. These will probably outlast me 
March 3,
++  Zojirushi EP EVC25 Electric Gourmet d' Expert: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this for Chinese / Japanese style hotpot.  It turned out to be a fabulous hotpot fast boiling time) and an excellent grill! Although there are no grill grids, my Korean BBQ and Cajun shrimps turned out wonderful!!!  I have used this pot extensively once or twice a week) for the past three months and it continues to perform superbly 
August 15,
 ++  Anolon Professional 12 Piece Nonstick Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have had these pans for five years now and I use them almost every night.  I have never had any problems with them and they cook the food very evenly.  I would highly recommend them.  
July 31,
 ++  Bodum 5410 01USA Mini Ibis 27 Ounce Electric Water Kettle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This thing is a workhorse... I use it every day. Mine's been going strong for over five years now. I just wish they'd bring back the translucent colors. I love being able to see at a glance whether the kettle has water in it or not. With the current opaque black or white models that's not possible. 
March 16,
 ++  Cuisipro Donvier Yogurt Starter: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have made yogurt with a few tablespoons from the super market or with a previous batch, but sometimes I sweeten the whole batch with honey and forget to reserve some of the good stuff.  I probably use these every other batch or so now. When I first started making yogurt, using these packets allowed me to vary the time and/or add powdered milk until I found my perfect batch!  I don't add powdered milk   it makes it thicker but more tart and I prefer it a bit thinner after getting addicted to it in Europe last year. This is the perfect tool for newbies   and a cupboard staple for the more seasoned yogurt heads 
July 17,
 ++  KitchenAid KV25GOXWW Professional 5 Plus 5 Quart Stand Mixer, White on White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great.   At this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer 
February 24,
 ++  Typhoon Professional 10 Inch Bamboo Steamer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  It's common to see these steamers all over the place and from Amazon's display, this certainly didn't look any different.  What made me decide to get this was the price and when I opened the box and examined it, I was pleased to find how well made this item is 
April 30,
 ++  Bissell 9200 ProHeat 2X Upright Deep Carpet Cleaner: Kitchen & Housewares ++  WE HAVE A NEW PUPPY AND I BOUGHT THIS CLEANER.  WHEN I READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS I ALMOST RETURNED IT UNOPENED.  FOR SOME REASON I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I HAD JUST RENTED AN INDUSTRIAL SIZED RUG DOCTOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO TO DO MY CARPETS.  I JUST WANTED TO TRY THIS TO SEE HOW IT WOULD DO.  THE DIRT AND DOG HAIR I GOT OUT WAS AMAZING.  IT WAS VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND TO USE.  I RECENTLY HAD SHOULDER SURGERY AND THIS WAS VERY EASY TO OPERATE WITH ONE ARM!  THANK YOU SO MUCH 
November 10,
 ++  Hoffritz 4 Piece Stainless Steel Measuring Spoon Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love to spend my time in the kitchen, but what I don't like to spend is obscene amounts of money. If I'm going to buy something I'd like to buy high quality so that I don't have to go buy it in a year or two.  I kind of balked at the price   I found plenty of measuring spoon sets for a third of the cost of this stainless steel set. But after receiving it and using it, I don't regret the extra money at ALL.   This set has been more than faithful to me in the time I've had it   it's dependable, I can toss it into the dishwasher with no fears and the labels won't rub off. I'm not afraid of abusing this set; it's stood up to my frantic mad dashes around the kitchen from the cookie dough to the spaghetti sauce. If your old set has worn down to nothing and you're looking for something that will stay in your kitchen longer and more faithfully than you will    this is the set for you. 
August 26,
 ++  Back to Basics SHP1000 Smoothie Professional Smoothie Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  After years of trying to make smoothies in a regular blender, and having to stop and stir, and stop and stir, and worry about burning out the motor, we now don't have to worry any more. Even when ALL of the fruit we add is frozen, this machine grinds, chops, and smooths with impressive power. It's fairly easy to clean, provided you don't wait for days, and has a handy pouring valve thing. A few recipes are included 
July 9,
 ++  Royal Heritage Home 1000 Thread Count 100% Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set, Stone: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am so pleased with these sheets.  Prior to this purchase, the most thread count I had in my sheets was 600.  These 1000 thread count sheets are much more luxurious.    In addition to the thread count quality, these sheets fit my bed better, are wider and deeper than my other sheets.  They cover my thick mattress with sheet to spare 
August 19,
 ++  Cuisinart DLC 10S Pro Classic 7 Cup Food Processor: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is my second DLC 10.  The only reason for replacement is because the bowl cracked and it became cost effective to just make a machine rerplacement.  I have all the disks and such and like the machine very much as I have had it for 20 years 
July 6,
 ++  Cuisinart DLC 10S Pro Classic 7 Cup Food Processor: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The processor works terrific! It saves us much time everyday. One minor problem is some foods get stuck between the cover and the blade and can not be processed 
January 18,
 ++  OXO Good Grips 2 Cup Angled Measuring Cup: Kitchen & Housewares ++  After reading some of the reviews, I was somewhat reluctant to buy this product, but it went on sale at $3.99, and I decided to risk it.  It measures up the the quality and function of most Oxo products.  The measurements on the side and inside are completely accurate, which is different from what some have described.  I like the cup better than my pyrex ones for dry and cold liquid products, but being plastic, it cannot be used for hot products that contain grease or oil.  The handle is ergonomically designed and is easy to scoop flour, sugar, beans, or other bulk products.  The only negative is that you have to have another measuring cup for hot, greasy products 
February 3, 
++  Brita Pitcher Cascade Model: Kitchen & Housewares ++  It's sort of cheap, but it works quite well.  The water comes out clean, with no odd taste which some filter systems can do) 
July 25,
 ++  Le Creuset 5 1/2 Quart Round French Oven, Dune: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is the best French Oven I have ever used. It cooks evenly and cleans easily. While it is very heavy, that must add to the excellence of its cooking and that's what I wanted. No complaints. 5 Stars 
July 22,
 ++  Westclox Travelmate: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am buying a replacement that I had for 15 years. It still works but the light went off.  I never thought they were still making it. I tried recently 2 other brands that did not make it 1 month paid around $25. I gave up, I was still using my old Westclck  until today when I found this one on Amazon. 
March 16,
 ++  Cuisinart CSK 150 1500 Watt Nonstick Oval Electric Skillet: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We have a large family and we use our electric skillet a lot.  In the past we have purchased the cheaper versions from Wal mart.  They don't heat evenly, and we were constantly replacing them because the cheap plastic legs or handles would break.  The Cuisinart CSK 150 1500 Watt Nonstick Oval Electric Skillet is AWESOME!!  The cooking area is huge we can cook 6 pancakes at a time easily) and the cooking surface heats up evenly.  It is very heavy, so it doesn't scoot around on the counter.  Nice metal handles an base.  Glass lid is also very sturdy with a steam vent.  It is very beautiful and functional. Because of the quality of the construction, I believe it will last our family for many years. I have not previously recommended any item online before, but I highly recommend this item 
November 14,
 ++  West Bend 77203 Electric Can Opener, Metallic: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have owned this can opener now for several months and it is BY FAR the BEST can opener I have ever owned.  I have had probably 10 electric openers in my lifetime, but this is just wonderful.  It is smooth, super easy to attach the can, quiet, and does NOT splatter the contents of the can all over the opener when it's done cutting like all the other did!!!  The detachable parts make it sanitary too, you can put it in the dishwasher! I can't say enough about this opener....you will NOT be disappointed!!  
October 26,
 ++  West Bend 77203 Electric Can Opener, Metallic: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Hey, not to be too redundant but this really is a good Can Opener. I have NO problems with it, my wife, who always has problems with can openers has "some" problems "sometimes" using it but as she NEVER could get any of the others to ever work this is a big improvement. The knife sharpener is an okay touch, however, if you have good knives I wouldn't use it. I sharpen by hand with an "Edge Pro" but hey, it's a CAN OPENER. It will sharpen a knife I just wouldn't put my $100 Schaaf "Golden Hamster" through, maybe my Chicago for a quick fix 
October 21,
 ++  Calphalon Contemporary 15 Piece Knife Set with Block: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've never had a "nice" set of knives before. These are great! They have a nice feel in my hands. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because the kitchen scissors do not come apart. The scissors I bought at Smart & Final come apart for easy washing and drying 
January 12,
 ++  Lodge Original Finish 2 Quart Camp Dutch Oven: Kitchen & Housewares ++  A dutch oven is one of the most versatile items you can find. Many people I know are intimidated by cooking with dutch ovens, but when you take a few minutes to learn how, you can use it to cook anything! It can be used with variety of foods: stews, cakes, cobblers, breads, poultry, vegetables basically anything you make in a conventional oven). If you happen to forget to pack your skillet when you go camping, turn over the lid and put it back on the dutch oven. Voila! Instant skillet type cooking surface!   Additionally, this smaller dutch oven stacks well with the 12 inch version, so you can cook more than one course at a time!  Having used a variety of dutch ovens in my life, I can tell you for sure, Lodge dutch ovens are the best. They are durable and well crafted. If you have ever had the experience of cooking with a dutch oven that was not a Lodge, you will know what I mean.   You should look for a dutch oven that has a lip on the lid for keeping coals on, and sturdy legs, to keep from crushing the coals. Lodge dutch ovens have these features, and are made of quality cast iron. Lodge also has many accessories for cooking, such as lid lifters and lid rests, inserts for muffins, etc.   Dutch ovens make a great gift for the camper in your life. Highly reccommended 
May 31,
 ++  Fire Safe Insulated Chest Size Safe, 12w x 7 1/2d x 3 1/2h: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The other review is so obviously someone from SENTRY that I thought I'd add my two cents. My house hasn't burned down so I don't know if this works, but I've read other articles that say it does. It is heavy since the foam contains water to evaporate and dissipate heat in a fire), and there is no rubber grips on the bottom, so it can slide around a lot. It's a lot cheaper and more convient than renting a safety deposit box. 
December 9,
++  Fire Safe Insulated Chest Size Safe, 12w x 7 1/2d x 3 1/2h: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Sentry Insulated Chest  Every household should have some method of protecting things like birth certificates, deeds, wills, stocks, bonds, and other valuables.  Pros:      Inexpensive box helps keeps your valuables "safe" from fire, kids, and nosey adults.     Attractive; has nice handle; no sharp edges.     Excellent value for the money.  Cons:      Flat key model SEN1100) has a rather cheap looking lock mechanism.     It weighs nearly 20 pounds, but that's because the walls are 1" thick and fire resistant material isn't light.  Go to sentrysafe dot com to view all the Sentry offerings.    My advice is to buy the Sentry model 2100 rather than this model SEN1100).  The 2100 has a better tubular key) lock, but only costs a few dollars more.  Staples dot com sells the 2100.)  Sentry rates these boxes as follows:  1100   UL classified   30 minute fire protection 2100   ETL verified for 30 minute fire protection of CDs and DVDs up to 1550 degrees F  No small fire box is particularly theft resistant.  Even if bolted down, a lid could be forced opened with tools.  In addition, although the 2100's fire rating is higher than the 1100, many non portable safes offer better fire ratings.  They are also larger and far more expensive.  For better protection, you'd need to spend more money, but a Sentry chest is much better than doing nothing.  I use mine to store DVD backups of computer files.  The Sentry chest is kept inside a large, fire resistant safe.  Hopefully, this double protection will do the job if there is ever a fire.  DVD and other computer media will be destroyed at much lower temperatures than paper.   I'm a retired Federal employee and have no connection whatever to any manufacturer of any product

January 29,
 ++  Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 5 Piece Starter Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  this set conducts heat really well and everything heats up fast but be careful not to burn anything which I did the first time using it. Also it takes a bit of scrubbing if you burn it bt other than that it's a great product 
November 4,
 ++  OXO Good Grips 34881 Ice Cube Tray: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I know these got poor reviews, as ice cube trays.  But I used them to freeze my baby's homemade fruits and veggies and they worked great.  The lids were a little tricky at first, but as long as you don't overfill them, you'll have no problems removing the lids.  A couple twists of the tray, and the food cubes slid right out!  They were much cheaper than trays marketed specifically for freezing baby food 
September 9, 2001 ++  OXO Good Grips 72891 Medium Spoon Spatula, Tomato: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I got this for my wife for her Birthday and she loves it. No more staining other spatula's or spoons 
March 6, 2003 ++  Fiesta Black 484 67 1/4 Ounce Large Disk Pitcher: Kitchen & Housewares ++  So when it came up on my Gold Box offers, I knew I had to have it !  It is great !  Beautiful, sleek and also useful !  It looks great in my yellow kitchen too !  The pitcher is heavy duty without feeling too heavy.  Makes a nice piece on your table during that special dinner at home

April 5,
++  Chantal 20 Ounce Ring Mug, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am very impressed with the feel and size of this mug.  It has a smooth feel, and keeps the coffee/tea hot/warm.  I ordered one, but will probably be ordering more! Nice! :o 
March 22,
 ++  Bodum Pavina Double Wall Cooler/Beer Glass, Set of 2: Kitchen & Housewares ++  These Bodum glasses are simply amazing.  There's no other way to describe a glass out of which I can have my coffee in the morning and ice cold liquids at night.  The added bonus is that liquid of any kind becomes a work of art in these glasses.  The liquid is suspended in space, and to top off the experience, the glasses never sweat and they never feel hot or cold to the touch.  Totally awesome...worthy of more than 5 stars 
December 30,
++  Bodum Pavina Double Wall Cooler/Beer Glass, Set of 2: Kitchen & Housewares ++  No picture can really do these glasses justice.  They have nothing aesthetic in common with any other double walled cup I've ever seen  elegant, minimalist, super clear and light as a feather.  They really keep stuff cold or hot, as the case may be).  They're even dishwasher safe.  However, they are remarkably fragile.  I accidentally rapped a spoon on the lip of one and within half an hour, the little crack had spread and the glass was in fragments.  But if you're careful with them and keep them away from kids, animals, and, apparently, me, they will serve you well

++  Famous Maker Supima Bath Towel 2 Pack, Cameo: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I ordered these towels in two colors mainly because the price was right.  But when they arrived I was so pleased.  They're larger than I expected and very plush.  I've washed them several times and they look as good as when I first opened them.  It's really nice to finally have towels that actually dry you off 
February 14,
++  Famous Maker Supima Bath Towel 2 Pack, Cameo: Kitchen & Housewares ++  These towels are great! I was surprised how large they are, but it's been a while since I bought towels, maybe all new towels are really big.  These towels are so absorbent, it's hard to tell when they've been used because the water just seems to disappear.  And soft, soft, soft...brand new out of the box they feel great.  Again, they're big, so a litle heavy, but they are wonderful.  These are an amazing bargain and feel very luxurious.  I don't know what towels those other reviewers said resulted in fuzzies, they must have been referring to another product, these towels are awesome, no fuzzies, they are very well made

 ++  ANOLON 3 Piece Chef's Cutlery Set 52624: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have used every major brand of cutlery and I can tell you there is no better value than analon knives. I have been cooking and managing restuarants for over 30 years and I have found that the $100 knives are no better than thr $25 ones. The analon product looks and feels just as nice as the most expnesive brands out there and is one third the price. Try them you will love them. I might add that all knives have to be reground from time to time as the edge will become blunt and no sharpener will restore it. When this happens find a local grinding service and have them restored. A good knife can last you a lifetime if you take care of it happy chopping Mik 
May 20,
++  ANOLON 3 Piece Chef's Cutlery Set 52624: Kitchen & Housewares ++  If you like knives that hold their edge, have good balance, and feel more expensive than they really are, this knife's a smart purchase.  We bought ours with the intent to get Henckels. My husband loves to cook and I have demanding standards for tools in my kitchen, especially knives.  Anolon were half the price and every bit as good.   As their reputation spreads, the prices seem to be going consistently up.

 ++  MIU France Stainless Steel Magnetic Knife Holder: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We looked in all the local brick and mortar stores for a quality holder with no luck.  Even though we were skeptical ordering online, this product far exceeded our expectations.  Do not hesitate, it is well worth the asking price 
March 1,
 ++  MIU France Stainless Steel Magnetic Knife Holder: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Everyone who comes in and sees this just loves it.  I'm getting several for Christmas presents this years to give to all my friends.  I mounted mine over the sink because that is where I do most of my slicing and dicing.  It also keeps my knives sharper because you're not sliding them in and out of the wood blocks.  It even holds my knife sharpener

 ++  Cuisinart CBT 500BW SmartPower Premier 600 Watt Blender, Matte Black Metal: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Enough said.  DON'T PUT A FROZEN JAR ON THE BASE AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO REPLACE THE BLADE ASSEMBLY.  I am sure the owners manual says that someplace.  My Kitchen Aid became unusable because replacement blades were not available 16 months after I purchased it.  Aren't you glad you could purchase the replacement part?  My story:  My son put his leftover smoothie into the freezer, jar and all.  The next day when he took the jar out of the freezer and put it on the Kitchen Aid blender, the motor broke the blade assembly.  The motor base was still good and I liked the blender.  Kitchen Aid changed their model and didn't make replacement parts.  I think it is unreasonable for a manufacturer to not have replacement parts available after just 16 months.  ...)!  I can't say enough good things about the quality and ease of use of my Cuisinart blender.  The jar's shape helps the food move and mix better than a round jar.  The jar's size is larger than any I have found.  I pour from the corner of the jar if the mix is too thick to pour from the spout which I concede is a little wide).  The weight keeps the blender in place.  The shipping weight is around 15 LBS is that too heavy?  Maybe you should skip the smoothies and switch to a muscle building drink.  Most every quality blender has weight to it.  The plastic units are light and considered disposable.  Keep buying those $30 disposable blenders if you want, however I'll keep my Cuisinart!  The three year warranty and Cuisinart's backing keep us, the consumer, in parts when we do something stupid like putting the frozen smoothie mix on the blender and breaking the blade assembly).  ...) replacement blade assembly is cheaper than being FORCED to purchase a new blender Kitchen Aid).  Buy the Cuisinart a great value for a quality product.

December 12, 2003 ++  Libbey  4 Piece Heidelberg Beer Mug Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  These are great beer mugs! I ordered 4 sets of them for myself and 2 for my brother. The first thing I noticed when I received them was that they were thick and HEAVY. The bottom isn't completely solid, but has space for a small pocket of air when it's sitting on the counter. It's inconsequential though, because the glass in these mugs is as thick as you would want any of your thick glass beer mugs. When I saw how nice they were, I actually went back online and bought 2 more and their margarita set which was also rediculously cheap $15 for 6 glasses and a picher). I've been recomending these mugs to all my friends that drink

Two quarters are the most handy in my kitchen and at least one non stick needs to be available. I use mine more and more just for the ease of clean up. The interior finish seems durable and shows no signs of damage. I would expect it to last a very long time with reasonable care. The price is great for the quality; you'll be pleased with your purchase.

 ++  Zyliss Ice Cream Scoop: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Listen to those other reviewers who have sung the praises of this scoop! The Zyliss Scoop goes through cold ice cream very well and literally drops off the scoop into the bowl. Well worth the money. How nice to have a tool that works well. Like others, I've tried many scoops that did NOT work   frustrating!! Do yourself a favor: stop bending your soup spoons and get a Zyliss Ice Cream Scoop.

++  NordicWare Egg Boiler: Kitchen & Housewares ++  It works great, and it's small 6" high, 5" diameter) and easy to use. May require some experimentation to get times correct for your own microwave. For me: 7 minutes for soft, 8 min for medium, and 9 10 min for hard eggs on high power 700W microwave).  It does get very hot, so you need to remove it from the microwave with a potholder or towel. I place the whole thing under the cold tap, then remove the top, and cool the eggs under running water for a minute before peeling

I just don't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product    it does exactly what it's meant to do with ease.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my aunt.  Before this, I made mashed potatoes with a masher; the difference is unbelievable.  I kept my masher because I'm a Southern girl and sometimes I want lumpy mashed potatoes.  This is easy to clean    throw it in the dishwasher

 ++  Holmes HASF 99  10 Inch Velocity Blizzard Stand Fan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I ordered this when it way below thirty bucks; a great deal for a workhorse of a fan.  In the heat of the last month, it's been going almost 24 hours a day, and it's not slowed down or stopped yet.   It's a bit noisier than the Vornado I have in the bedroom, but on the other hand, it's a stronger fan.  I watch television in the same room, and don't have any problem, so unless you're extremely sensitive to sound, it's fine.  Be careful moving it around;  The "head" of the fan tends to come off the base if you aren't paying attention.  It locks in place when you put it down, but moving it seems to make it "unlock."  
March 11,
 ++  OXO Good Grips 76681 5 Piece Nylon Tool Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Initially I was very surprised by how large the tools were. They are much bigger than any tool I've bought previously. If you don't have much space in the kitchen, I'd think twice about buying these tools.  However, after using them I think they are quite sturdy and useful.  Eventhough they are large, they are not heavy and sometimes there size is quite helpful.  You can pick up a whole fried egg with the spatula, for example. I am happy with my purchace, because the price was good

++  Lodge Pro Logic Cast Iron Aebleskiver Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've been cooking aebleskivers for several years in an excellent no name cast iron pan that I bought in Solvang ten years ago.  It is very well broken in with a smooth non stick patina in all seven indents.  I want to teach my sons how to cook aebleskivers themselves because they will be out on their own soon, and it never hurts to be able to attract a woman who loves Danish delicacies!    Therefore, I have been looking to buy some additional aebleskiver pans and I was excited to see this new pan from Lodge, so I ordered one to give it a try.  I like the design a lot and am impressed with how it heats up quickly and holds it's temperature nicely.  The first batch of aebleskivers had some sticking, but I expected that.  I will need to use it a lot more before it has the same non stick surfaces as my old pan no, it's not for sale!), but I can tell that this pan will get there with use.  By the way, I've found that there are many recipes for aebleskivers and several different techniques for cooking them.  I'm sure that they all will work well with some practice, but I'll describe the one that I've settled on, because it is so easy:  Heat the pan at a medium low setting.  Take about two cups of prepared pancake mix I use Krusteaz Buttermilk) and add a couple of teaspoons of sugar.  Mix it in and stir in enough cold water to make the consistency about the same as you would for drop bisquits.  Don't overmix it and let it sit for awhile to rise a bit before you cook it.  Put a little butter or margerine in each indent and add about a teaspoonful of batter to each indent If you're new to aebleskivers, I recommend trying only three at once.)  I then drizzle a little butter on the edges of each indent.  After about a minute, I use a knitting needle or chopstick) to turn each aebleskiver one quarter turn.  I add a little more butter and then turn them so the round side is up.  I keep turning them with a spoon until they're done.  You'll just have to break one of them open to check, because it's dependent on your batter and temperature.)  Once you get it down usually after a few rejects), serve them in threes on a small plate with thinned out raspberry jam and powdered sugar.  Once you eat them, you'll understand why people go through all this just to make a pancake that looks like a racquetball!

 ++  Hamilton Beach 76600 Smooth Edge Can Opener: Kitchen & Housewares ++  i've had this can opener 4 more than 5 years & have never had a problem!!!  i even let my 4 year old niece use it when she stays with me & helps me cook.  never have 2 worry about anything with this one 
January 30,
 ++  Hamilton Beach 76600 Smooth Edge Can Opener: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a wonderful can opener!!! I wouldn't have any other. The trick to having perfectly cut edges is to let the can spin around twice. I hold onto the can so that when it starts making its second round, I tighten my grip a little and the moment the lid comes lose it starts spinning. I have noticed that if I buy the dirt cheap, no name vegetables at the dollar store, the opener has difficulty. I guess one should blame the can and not the opener. It is a small price to pay for having such a safe appliance around. But then my opener is a couple years old so maybe my blade is just wearing out... If there is no replacement blade, you can bet I will buy another can opener just like this, and if I have to, on Ebay!  I am sure this new technology has saved more than one lost or stray animal digging at the landfill or in the alley for a morsel of food. I just couldn't bear the thought of someone's lost puppy or an abandoned cat getting his tongue cut. Those old can openers are just plain dangerous. Call me a bleeding heart but it matters. It's not like my own pet couldn't knock the trash over when I'm gone and end up cutting themselves on one of those old fashioned, razor sharp lids. There are both elderly and child relatives in my house all the time and I just don't feel safe with those old tin cutters around.  All it takes is a little patience with new technology and using this can opener on more than just a couple cans to get the hang of it. There is no need to slam this appliance on the counter or floor. That's rediculous. As far as oversized cans, that's not what this was made for.   
December 26, 2002 ++  OXO Good 73981 Grips Rolling Pin: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have to admit that I was surprised when the rolling pin arrived. I'm used to OXO quality, but this is over the top. It is a big rolling pin, with an ideal diameter. It is also heavy. It's heft helps keep it where it belongs, instead of bouncing around on the dough and making you work harder. It has a strong axle, which glides remarkably smoothly, even when the pressure is on. The hard non stick surface works very well, and does not pick up butter grease like some other coatings. The handles are simply the best I have have encountered. This is a very well designed kitchen tool that fully lives up to the &quot;Good Grips&quot; promise of quality 
January 18,
 ++  Zojirushi Classic Stainless Lunch Jar, Metallic Gray: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had seen my Japanese coworkers carry this thing to work.  It's a great lunch bag! Beats brown bagging, because hot foods stay hot, and cold foods stay cold.  I finally bought one because of the ease of use, didn't want to keep paying $$$ for hot lunches, and I can always bring my favorite foods.  The bottom container is the only leakproof container. That is my only gripe.) I usually put soup in here.  The other containers will hold things without sauces very well.  It's great because it allows for a large variety of foods better nutrition).  I have used bento lunch boxes since I was kid, and this is the best for adults. I like asian food, and this type of lunch box accomodates the best.   If you want to fill hot food, then pour in hot water in the containers for 10 minutes, let it get warm.  Pour out the water, dry.  Then fill.  If you want ice cold food, put in freezer for 10 minutes, then put food in.     They also make bigger versions for larger appetites and another smaller one for small appetites.  They really do stay hot. Once I had to take a very late lunch, I packed it at 7am, and at 2:30pm the food was still hot. No more waiting in line to microwave your lunch !!!

I love them

 ++  T Fal OT8085002 Avante Elite Convection Toaster Oven: Kitchen & Housewares ++  When I decided to buy this oven, I was not even looking to buy a convection toaster oven.  I stumbled across this item looking for cookware.  I read all the reviews, thought about it a few days and then decided to just buy it.  Boy, am I glad that I did!!!  And so is my family.  The day we received it, I cooked muffins for my daughter and her friend for a snack.  Extremely easy.  All I needed was six muffins and the oven did just that for me.  Since then, we have cooked more muffins, a meatloaf, bacon, toast, english muffins, chicken strips, waffles and bratwurst.  My kitchen doesn't heat up like when I use my regular oven and the food has turned out better than when cooked in the regular oven.  It was so easy for my husband to use this also while I was shopping and I just gave him a 15 second class before I left.  I didn't notice any smoking when cooking meat or any of the other foods.  This is my first Convection Toaster oven, which has replaced the microwave and toaster, and I can assure you we expect to use this oven alot.  I love the design, the warming tray does just that, even when you have something else cooking you can throw buns or anything else up top to keep warm.  It's great! The oven is big enough to cook meatloaf or chicken breasts and yet is not so monstrous that you lose your entire counter for one appliance.  I would recommend this to anyone.  What a great idea for the kitchen 
September 28,
 ++  T Fal OT8085002 Avante Elite Convection Toaster Oven: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Very good buy for $85 +free ship. Bought this one to replace a smaller Black & Decker toaster oven that served us very well over 5 6 years until controls gave out the B&D still works, just have to keep the button pressed in).    I looked at reviews of several toaster ovens before purchasing the T Fal.  The less expensive ones $25 $40) were getting dinged because of occasional mentions of overheating or fire risk.  Not worth the chance.  I also wanted something as small as possible because we have little counter space in our 10' x 10' kitchen, so a more expensive one was not an option.    The T fal gave dimensions on Amazon & it was 3 inch wider, deeper, taller than our B&D.  No big deal   wrong.  It was bigger than I thought when I put it on the counter, looked like a monster compared to the B&D.  Also, I could not open the top warmer lid to the point it stays open.  This because of height restrictions    bottom of my kitchen cabinet is at about 54   60 inches.  I can open the top, but I need to hold it open.  My fault, not the product or mfr.  But be aware that size matters in a small kitchen.  The function buttons are very simple, nothing complicated   one button for toast, one for bake, another for broil.  You can set how long it stays on, and it beeps electronically) three times when it shuts off.  There is a clock, but it could be easier to set.    I mainly use it to toast bread, bagels, sandwiches and to bake small pizzas sauce with cheese on a pita   easy).  The toast function takes longer than the old B&D about 4.5 vs 2 minutes), but thats OK by me.  The bake function works very well, I prefer it muchly over starting the oven to bake something small.  Clean up is a snap with a removeable crumb tray, glass doors and non stick surfaces.  Negatives: you can pull the rack out about 30 40 percent before it tips forward and burns you.  It's controllable, not a big deal, unless you don't know about it.  I did know thanks to previous reviews and I was prepared for it.   The fan was louder than I expected I expected no noise since the B&D has no fan).  But it is a soft sound, lower than my computer fan and only on during cooking.  Overall, it's a well built, well designed machine.  
July 6,
 ++  Salter 2001 5 Pound Microtronic Kitchen Scale, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Overall this is a fine scale.  One "convenient" feature is an auto zero function.  If the scale has been tared and the tare weight removed, rather than displaying a negative weight, the scale automatically re zeros.  This may be handy most of the time, but sometimes it's a pain.  With my old scale, I could tare a partially filled bowl, remove the bowl from the scale, add more goodies, and place it back on the scale to determine the weight of the additional material.  That doesn't work with this scale  it rezeros when a tared weight is removed 
July 24,
 ++  Pyrex 14 Piece Storage Set with Lids: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I hope these things are airtight because I just bought my fourth set.  I don't buy the freezer storage containers because I own these.  They can be used in cooking and freezing so I save on pricey disposable freezer bags. The little ones I use to store one package each of corn starch, yeast, baking powder, baking soda, three hamburger patties and to prepare, freeze and bake individual sized servings of salmon fillets.  The medium ones and the large ones are for leftovers, soup fixings, freezer meals, steaming chicken, fruit salad et al.   I'm ten percent tempted to try out the rectangular ones because some foods I don't want to freeze in a stack but I don't think I would get as much use out of them as I do these round ones.  I really would like to buy a fifth set but I won't. I rarely have more than one or two empty ones to spare. These get used all the time. I really didn't like using plastic wrap or aluminum foil to refrigerate food.  These lids are more secure and therefore I am less stressed

 ++  AeroBed Premier Raised, Queen: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The AeroBed Premier Raised Queen sized bed is a Godsend.  Due to a disability, I needed a raised bed that would allow me the convenience of a somewhat normal height bed, so my husband & I could camp with other family members at a recent family reunion.  The AeroBed Premier Raised not only afforded me that ability, but also provided a surprisingly comfortable night's sleep as well.  The bed is made of the highest quality material, and did not lose any air.   I needed a dependable product, as I would not have tried this with a cheap airbed.  I got all that I wanted in purchasing the AeroBed Premier Raised Queen sized bed, plus I now have a comfortable extra bed for overnight guests.

++  Simply Calphalon Nonstick 12 Inch Jumbo Chicken Fryer with Stainless Steel Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Although it's a 'chicken fryer', I use it to pan fry everything, and it works amazing! The depth of the pan allows larger amount of food inside, being stirred without spilling out. And the smaller diameter helps to concentrate heat in the pan. The nonstick feature truly works, nothing sticks to the pan, even the thick starch

However, I can tell you that this is a durable mattress pad.  It went camping with us without a problem.  And it washes easily.  those are important factors to consider

++  T Fal Perfection Hard Enamel 13 Inch Saute Pan, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Love the pan, the center is so cool, because you can tell when the product is pre heated.....the center changes and it is so great.

October 2, 2003 ++  T Fal Perfection Hard Enamel 13 Inch Saute Pan, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This pan suited my needs exactly.  It's handle is comfortable to hold and it has nice even heat distribution.  The handle and the curve of the outside edge make flipping food quite easy

February 21,
 ++  Corelle Coordinates Abundance 4 Piece Bake and Serve Casserole Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I recently broke two of my favorite pieces of Corelle Baking and Serving Dishes. I looked on several sites and it seemed all I could find was the handleless French Style Corningware, which I have and find hard to use due to being without handles. This Bakeware has great handles and I love it. I love the Chutney on the side, I compared this price with ordering just two piece of the same thing in Abundance Design and the oblong baking dish separate and it was $10.00 more without the ramkins. This was a better value 
December 26, 2003 ++  Pfaltzgraff Pistoulet Les Amis de Pistoulet Bread Plates, Set of 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I like the pistoulet dinnerware and specially the bread plates.  But after some dishwasher, the paint begin to peel off. At least, I got a excellent customer service from Pfaltzgraff and they have exchanged the product.  Good advice, dont place them in the dishwasher

 ++  KitchenAid K45SBWH Bowl for Pivot Head Stand Mixer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am an avid baker. Sometimes you need to whip up your egg whites to fold in later. Having an extra bowl makes this so much easier than transferring to a different type bowl. Or maybe you are making Christmas cookies   you can have one batter chilling in the fridge while you are mixing another one. It's well worth the money 
July 26,
++  Soehnle 66524 Futura Digital Food Scale, 11 Pounds Capacity: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this scale back in Jan or Feb. I needed one and after looking around for a while found that I liked this one the best because of its easy to read decimile display  pounds on one side, ounces down to the tenth) on the other side. The lb/k switch is located on the bottom side of the unit and I don't find it inconvient down there. This scale also has a auto shutoff feature that helps save your batteries but has never shut off while I'm in the middle of measuring. Because of previous complaints to that effect when I first got mine I timed how long it would stay on ending up with close to 2.5 min before it did. I also love the look of the scale it is sleek and stylish, very clean lines and is easy to clean too, just a quick wipe down and I'm done. As a note to Alton Brown fans this is his scale of choice on Good Eats. The price tag may have you shying away but I assure you that its worth every penny. I would not trade mine for anything! 
July 20, 2001 ++  All Clad Stainless Open Stir Fry Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I do a lot of stir frying, using one pan to do many dishes.  As a result I needed a pan that had non stick quality for quick and easy cleaning and one that could take high heat from my professional stovetop.  When pan and oil are heated to the right temperature the interior 18/10 stainless steel surface behaved as if it were nonstick.  The heat was evenly conducted bottom through the sides, this due to the aluminium core sandwich being continuous from the bottom up the sides.  The sides are high enough to not have food spill out in the process of vigourous stir frying. The height is also good for small item deep frying.  The steep sloping of the sides enabled food to rotate well, falling back easily into the pan.  Quality pans tend to be heavy,  All Clad without exception but this size is perfectly manageable for tossing ingredients if need to.  It also cooks a generous portion for one to two persons.  All typesincluding metal) of utensils can be used with it.  This is a solid, handsome and versatile pan with wonderful easy care and use.  It is a total joy to cook with and one that gives you confidence that it will last a long, long time

 ++  Breville ESP8XL Caf� Roma Stainless Espresso Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I first would like to say that if you are the occasional esspresso drinker, then this machine is to costly to use every once in a while go with a cheaper brand.  Now for the rest of you that are die hard esspresso drinkers this is the machine for you.  I moved from AK to NY a few months ago, while I lived in AK ALASKA) there were coffe shops on every corner, to say the least I was addicted to mochas, and moving to NY they are few and far between.  I was going into withdrawl.  After doing some research I found this great machine.  I wanted to use it for a while before writing a review about it.  I love this machine.  This machine is fast and the esspresso is great.  I am a fan of regular esspresso as well and it comes out at a consistanly high quality,  the Crema is perfect, however I found if you are using the single shot it doesn't come out that great so always use the double shot.  The machine heats up quickly and everything is provided for you, two cups, two saucers, a pitcher and a frothing attachment.  I can see that this machine will pay for itself withing no time.  I have owned cheaper models in the past and you can really tell the difference in the quality of the esspresso.  I have not used the pod attachment so I can't comment on that.  If you buy the machine in my opinion you wont be disappointed

 ++  Rowenta DX 8800 1750 Watt Professional Iron: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I find this iron very easy to use.  The multiple steam holes makes ironing easier and faster.  I have a small problem with it spitting water.  I have tried using 1/2 tap and 1/2 spring water and I have tried adjusting the steam flow, but it still tends to spit.  Overall, I am very pleased with this iron.

 ++  Emile Henry Le Potier  9 Inch Pie Dish, Green: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I adore my Emile Henry pie dish.  It was my first piece of Emile Henry and worth every cent.  The dish is beautiful and durable.  It cleans up nicely, you don't have to worry about scratching and sticking is not a problem.    I baked stuffed sole in it tonight and the results were wonderful.  Evenly cooked, no sticking, no burning.  For special occasion pies it is a huge asset.  Bringing a homemade apple pie to the table in a classic dish definitely ups the WOW factor.  In addition to the presentation value it bakes like a dream.  Crisp, even, golden crusts and bubbly filling.  Its also great with egg dishes like quiche that require very even heating for best results.    Even if you are only the occasional baker you won't result splurging on an heirloom pie dish.

 ++  Eureka 431AXZ Optima Lightweight Upright Vacuum: Kitchen & Housewares ++   It vacuums dog hair like nothing else I've used but you have to clean it every other time you use it. The cord could use 10' or so in additional length. The handle retracts nicely and it's light weight makes it easy to move around. I think the thing I like about it the most is the narrow suction strip or whatever it's called. I think the high power motor coupled with the narrow strip equates to superior suction but a little more time in use.  This vacuum is totally worth the $60

 ++  Farberware Millennium Soft Touch Stainless Steel 12 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am really pleased with this purchase. This cookware far exceeded my expectations. It's heavyweight but not too heavy. I just love the cool touch handles. I would recommend this set very highly. If you cook alot like I do you will be more than happy with this set. 
November 5,
 ++  Farberware Millennium Soft Touch Stainless Steel 12 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have been very happy with this cookware. It is very well made, heavy and sturdy. This is the most expensive set I have ever bought, and the difference is stunning. The pans heat very quickly and get much hotter than my old pans.  I have had to change my cooking style to accommodate the better pans. I like being able to put them in the oven and not worrying about caring for a possibly) toxic non stick coating. Well worth the money

May 5, 2001 ++  Farberware Classic 8 Quart Stockpot with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Farberware 18/10 stainless steel cookware is a good line. I had this cookware at one time, and I can recommend it, especially for use on gas burners. Unlike Calphalon cookware, it can go in the dishwasher. However, to keep the finish gleaming, you might need to scrub the pots and pans frequently with cleanser and scouring pads. The 8 Quart Stockpot with Lid is a kitchen essential

++  Zojirushi AFFB10S Premium Thermal 1 Liter Carafe, Brushed Stainless Steel: Kitchen & Housewares ++  So far this has been a great product. I've had it for about a year and a half and have used it almost every day to hold boiling water for making tea.  So far it has held up great.  This carafe keeps the water near boiling for at least 5 hours. When I leave the water in it for 24 hours, the water is still warm enough for me to make tea with it.    I have never used this item to store anything else other than water; but in theory, you should be able to make tea or coffe the night before and still have it hot in the morning 6 to 8 hours later, assuming the liquid is boiling when you pour it in.    Some of the heat from the water is lost from the initial contact with the carafe, so the liquid you store will always be a little cooler than its intial temperature.

++  Simply Calphalon Stainless 10 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We received another set for our wedding, but I am considering taking it back to Macy's where this Calphalon 10 piece set was on sale for $399.00 this weekend.  Same set, same pieces!!  I can't believe it.  These pans feel great are durable but won't weigh you down while you are cooking  The analon advanced brand I got is so heavy!!   Yesterday, I paid $99.99 for just the 12 inch Calphalon fry pan and I feel it was worth it given how much I have used the 10 inch so far.  These are the only two pieces I have from this calphalon collection so far, but I want more. Oh and although they say not to use this particular nonstick line in the dishwasher, you'd be totally lazy if you had too because cleanup is so easy with these!!  It's amazing

 ++  Hamilton Beach 40911 2 Quart Electric Iced Tea Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  For years we have used the Mr. Coffee Iced Tea makers and have purchased two of them.  This time around we chose to get the Hamilton Beach 40911 2 qt Iced Tea Maker.  Even though I/we haven't used the feature that allows you to place loose tea in the basket for brewing we totally like the Hamilton Beach method of brewing tea over the Mr. Coffee.  First of all the taste using Luzianne Family Tea bags was superior to any tea we ever brewed using the Mr. Coffee makers.   Also one very large drawback with the Mr. Coffee maker is that the basket, for the bags, sets inside the reservoir and maker and most every time you brew a pitcher and remove the basket you have leakage of tea down in the makers bottom which over time makes for a very ugly looking reservoir, where you put your clean water to brew your next pitcher.  Because Hamilton Beach placed the basket directly inside the Pitcher itself there is never any tea that finds its way into the bottom of the tea maker.  Also due to ridges in the bottom of the Mr. Coffee maker it's usually almost impossible to totally clean the pitcher and restore it back to the clean condition at the time you first used it.  This feature alone makes the Hamilton Beach a better buy over the Mr. Coffee but I thought, before my purchase, that surely the two would make equivalent tasting tea but using both Lipton and Luzianne Family Tea bags the Hamilton Beach not only brews the tea faster but the taste IS Better.  On the Mr. Coffee the strength of the tea is controlled by a sliding knob on the front of the maker whereas with the Hamilton Beach it is three rigid clicks of control on the bottom of the basket mild, medium, strong), we usually use Medium.    We enjoy "Sweet Tea" being from the South and anyone that makes good sweet tea knows you sweeten it while it's hot at the time of brewing.  Our method is to first fill the pitcher to the line and fill the reservoir and refill the pitcher to the same water level and then add 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups of sugar and stir with a whisk until very well mixed.  Once the tea is brewed you have to stir the tea again but you get perfect sweet tea every time.  If you enjoy tea, even if you never considered an electric tea maker, the Hamilton Beach will be one purchase decision you will not regret.  Having two Mr. Coffee makers before this Hamilton Beach I don't see myself ever purchasing another Mr. Coffee unless they make many changes to their product and even then taste is the final decision maker.  I HIGHLY recommend the Hamilton Beach model and would gladly buy it again even if it was higher priced than the Mr. Coffee, it's totally worth it

 ++  Anolon Sure Grip Bakeware 5 Piece Bakeware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am very impressed with this set. The pans are of heavy guage steel and have rolled edges.  I had 3 pounds of chicken on the cookie sheet and with a one handed lift the pan did not flex as my other pans did, again heavy guage steel.  The handles and the nonstick surface have had no problems at 450 degrees. Other brands that I have used deteriorate rapidly at 400 degrees or above. Keep in mind I am not a cook and by my very method of cooking set oven to high and wait til you smell something burning) I am very hard on pans of any kind. A very high quality product that I would have gladly paid 50 bucks for. By the way, the cooling rack is nonstick as well.

 ++  Henckels Everedge Plus 13 Piece Block Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I needed a set of knives like yesterday I had a ...] set of Chicago Cutlery knives they lasted 2 years the blades chipped and resharpen them were impossible because of the chipping, the handles faded and they had rust spots and I am not hard on knives I even hand washed them most of the time. So I bought these knives because they were Henckles and the never needed sharpening. I have had them 3 months they are perfect for me. they are made in China.   3 of the knives got rust spots after 2 washing I called the company and they ask me to return the defectived knives and they replaced them in a very timely manner.  So for 49.99 I have knives that Look great Work great and if there is any problem the company will replace them.  So You can't go wrong

 ++  KitchenAid Silicone Short Turner, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Calling it short is a misnomer   it's not that short   it's an average size. It has a rather bulky handle that is comfortable to hold but difficult to store. The turner itself is a little on the thick side so lighter foods don't always want to cooperate but I'm pleased with it. I wouldn't buy a matching spoon becuase of the bulky handle   takes up too much room in my drawer

 ++  Black & Decker  DCM500 SmartBrew 5 Cup Coffeemaker, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  With the advent of fancy featured coffee makers this is the right coffee maker for us.  We like to brew 1 large mug of coffee at a time so we have fresh tasting coffee.  Most models now have a carafe with the stop brew feature so you can pour out a cup while it is brewing.    But you must use their carafe.  With this maker you can use your own mug.  And if the carafe breaks and it costs as much as the maker to replace sometimes) you can still use the maker with the mug or other container.  I sometimes use a stainless steel pitcher.  Sure this maker isn't fancy, but I just want a simple cup of coffee and this maker does it with an appliance that doesn't take up lots of counter space.  I haven't had any problems with messes or clean up with this maker

 ++  Black& Decker DCM2500 SmartBrew 12 Cup Coffeemaker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've had lots of coffemakers over the years, and always had a problem pouring the coffee into a cup. It ran over the side and made a mess, unless you poured it very slowly. I saw this model a few years ago and decided to try it. It is great. I will never own anything else. I have been looking for one to replace my old one, only because the heating element is dirty/rusty looking my wife doesn't like it). In fact I'm going to buy one right now on Amazon, as I've looked at a few stores and the new Black and Decker models I have seen,don't have the dripless pouring spout

++  BonJour 4103 43 Tea For Two 3 piece Tea Drop Set, Stainless: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a fantastic idea for teaballs. Sleek and stylish, this set is also practical.  The two teaballs are spring loaded, and perfectly sized for a single cup of tea. Simply press the plunger, then stir the ball around in your loose tea container. Lift it out of the tea and shake the excess out to level the tea. Let go of the plunger, and the teaball closes securely. The long stem on the balls allow you to take the ball out of your cup or stir the tea as it's brewing, if that's your preference) without having to lift a hot chain off of the side of your cup of hot water.  Prior to this purchase, we used a tea 'spoon', which also spring loaded shut. The problem with the spoon is that to fill it with tea, you have to hold it vertically in the container, which means you have few options   either close the spoon while the tea is still sticking out the sides, and fill your cup with loose tea, or try to shake the extra tea out after you pull the spoon of the container, and get tea all over your counter. Because of these teaballs' design, they don't share that problem.  The tower has one interesting feature, but some shortcomings. The good design is that below where each teaball hangs, there is a significant 'bowl' to catch any tea that might still be dripping. This has proven to be a very handy feature. The tower itself isn't very mobile, however. Due to how the hooks hold the teaball stems, it is seemingly impossible to move without one of the balls falling out. Also, when I got mine, the tower was visibly crooked, and I had to bend it back straight. That worked for me, but was quite hard, and I was worried I'd break it.  Oh, cleanup   cleanup is much easier than with the aforementioned spoon. The spoon hinges so that there is little clearance at the back of the utensil for washing out. These balls don't share that problem at all. The plunger gives more than adequate clearance to simply turn the ball sideways and wash it out in the sink just make sure your sink's filter is in!)  All in all, I'm pleased with the purchase. It's such a fantastic idea that a few shortcomings don't significantly mar how well the product works

 ++  Progressive International Oven Mitts 2 Pack, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love these oven mitts.  They have a magnet in them so you can stack them one on top of the other and stick them to your oven or refrigerator, or other metal surface.

 ++  Taylor 9842 Professional Waterproof Digital Thermometer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have had this for almost a year, and for the money I cannot recommend a better product. I would buy another 
September 12,
 ++  Taylor 9842 Professional Waterproof Digital Thermometer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  In my opinion:  Well, I ordered two of these, one for my Daughter. Since I had two, guess what I did? You're right   I tested both on the same hot and cold materials to see how close they read. Well, they were within 1/2 degree F. of each other, which in a laboratory is sloppy, but for cooking food, it's darn accurate.   I have several oven thermometers, you know, the mechanical ones, and I use this unit to see how accurate they are.  Also, I wanted a thermometer to be able to check the temperature of thinner foods, such as a hamburger, chicken patty, chicken breasts. Now, as you know, when you check the temperature of these items, you want a really quick reading, because your hand is close to the heat. Well, it's not as quick as advertised. It will take about 8 to 10 seconds to get a good reading, but that's not terribly long. Make sure you slide the temp probe through the handle so that your hand can be even further away from the fire.  Next, it can be calibrated, so I put it up against a $400 Fluke meter, and it came within .8 degrees F, so I would consider it within specs. For food preparation, the difference would have no meaning.   Finally, it seems to be holding up well against accidental drops and getting slightly wet. I've bought others, including those ridiculous forks with the built in thermometers, but this unit is the best

When I opened the box and first lifted the saucepan, I was immediately impressed with the weight and quality.  Each time that I use this pan to heat up foods, I am constantly surprised at how much less time it takes for those foods to cook.  Water boils very quickly.  Lastly, the engraved measuring lines for liquids are  extremely helpful.  All in all, the best saucepan that I've owned

Dried it, sprayed cooking spray and filled it with my cake batter and popped it in the preheated oven.  37 minutes later a gorgeous cake was baked.  I turned the pan over on a wire rack and my cake fell right out without one crumb stuck in the pan.  I'm going to give this pan as gifts in the future.   This cake design is especially lovely when you dust the cake with powdered sugar and cinnamon..............

 ++  Sassafras La Cloche Brick Oven: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I used La Cloche to make bread with, specifically San Francisco Sourdough, with SPECTACULAR results. The crust was crisp but chewey, and I could not imagine baking another loaf without it. But after I used it the first time, the bottom developed a crack. After a second use, the crack became so large that I will not use it again for fear it will break during cooking.  I called Sassafras Enterprises 800.537.4941), and for $8.00 to cover shipping/handling they are sending out a replacement bottom. Their customer service was outstanding, and I feel they build a quality product. I also purchased the rectangular version of La Cloche, and I have not had an issue. Perhaps our La Cloche was damaged during shipping. I would have rated it 5 stars otherwise 
December 7,
++  Sassafras La Cloche Brick Oven: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love to bake.  I really love to bake bread.  My specialty is sourdough.  So now I have 3 strikes against me, that is, until I found La Cloche.    Although it can be used to cook meats, I personally only use it for bread.  La Cloche turns your regular oven into a brick oven, and the quality of your bread will amaze you.  It browns beautifully, has a crispy, chewy crust that seems to carmelize the sugars in the crust differently.  There is no need to spray water or create steam in the oven, because the steam is created inside La Cloche by the bread itself.  So actually bread making is more simple and safe because you are not spraying water into a 500 degree oven.   There are 2 shapes, a french bread style and round oven hearth style.  I have both and pop them into the oven at the same time, so I am baking 2 loaves of bread at once, which is a little more economical.     Truly, I wish I had this from the beginning of my baking attempts.  If you are a baker or love one, go ahead and spring for it.  You will never regret this kitchen tool.   All my other bread pans are now unused

 ++  Global D�cor 18/10 Stainless Steel 8 Piece Chopsticks: Kitchen & Housewares ++  First of all, they aren't really intended for the novice user, but they are perfect for the long run. The wooden ones WILL rot before you ever get skilled with them, but these stainless steel ones will take a licking and keep on picking.  One thing the description doesn't say, is that they ARE made to be used as chopsticks and they can really function like them.   Maybe on the descriptions from before they said they are slippery and they don't have any grip. I never had any problem with that depending on what I tried to grab. I was able to grab chopped steaks and even some vegetables with these utensils, though I haven't tried noodles yet.  Another thing I need to point out that the description doesn't. These utensils aren't round. The handles are square, as the points are rounded. The tips are blunted so grabbing things becomes awkward until you learn to get "around" the item you want to pick up. If you know how to use chopsticks and pick up things with them, you'll only have a very slight adjustment to make with these.  All in all, for their originality and how they are made, I give them a four and a half out of five.  If you wanted chopsticks to replace fickle and often unwashable wooden ones, these are the kind you want to get, definately

 ++  Global D�cor 18/10 Stainless Steel 8 Piece Chopsticks: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My mother is Korean and so I grew up using stainless steel chopsticks.  Apparently they're quite popular in Korean households...as well as stainless steel rice bowls.  You might have seen them, the ones with the stainless lids?  Anyway.  These are just like the ones I grew up using.  There are some drawbacks like the noodle comment made earlier) but it's not a product flaw.  Yes, wooden chopsticks are going to grip better, but they also tend to mildew if used repeatedly and have to be restocked.  Lacquer coated wooden chopsticks tend to flake after a while.  And besides, when eating asian food you don't really pick up individual noodles which would have you slipping and sliding).  You sorta grab a large portion and bring your face close to the bowl and slurp them down.  I think the Japanese actually bring the bowl to their face instead.  Trust me...it all goes where it needs to.    The main thing is getting use to their diameter.  These are much more slender than the wooden chopsticks you see in restaurants.  Not for the novice chopsticker

++  KitchenAid Silicone Loaf Pan, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have this and mini pans and muffin pans   all silicone. They are great. The biggest problem is that the bread tends to expand the sides of the soft pan so the sides are a bit wider. I never oil the pans and the bread pops out easily. The muffins too ususally since the recipe often has oil in it.  Great product. Never noticed any odd taste/smell

++  KitchenAid Silicone Loaf Pan, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  A wonderful product.  Everything cooks very evenly.  No sticking.  So easy to wash and store also

 ++  Shark EP750H 18 Volt Cordless 2 in 1 Hand & Floor Vac with Super Sized Motorized Brush and Twister Technology: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've had this model of the Shark for a couple of months now and it is working great. It has a powerful suction compared to my Duster Buster. I have had no problems with the battery so far and it seems to last the adertised 15 minutes. I too concerned over the HEPA filters.  You can do a decent job cleaning it and I plan to clean it well with my ShopVac to extend the life. The vacuum and accessories fit nicely into the stand. I would definitely recommend this product for quick vaccums around the house and in the car

 ++  Nissan 18 Ounce Stainless Steel Insulated Travel Tumbler: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My husband drinks coffee continuously. Whenever we are in the car, I'm always after him not to spill his coffee and I constantly have to clean up the inevitable spills. We could never find a good cup that would fit in the cup holder so the spills were always on the floor or in his lap. This cup does spill if it's tipped over I don't think any cup will ever be completely spill proof) but it fits in the cup holder and therefore doesn't spill as easily. I bought two, one for him and one for me I drink ice water and tea) and they both fit together nicely side by side in our cars cup holder. They keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for long periods of time. I have purchased loads of cups over the 34 years of our marriage and this has to be the best by far. I would highly recommend this item for everyone!

 ++  Simply Calphalon Nonstick 5 Quart Chili Pot: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I really wanted a 5 quart pot and wouldn't want to spend a lot of $$$.  This turned out to be a great buy.  It is a very good quality product.  The non stick surface seems very well coated.  It's very versatile for us a family of 4).  I am very pleased and satisfied with the product 
October 16, 2001 ++  BIA Cordon Bleu 900180 4 Piece Soup Tureen Set with Ladle, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Its a traditional serveware for serving the soup course The color of the tureen set allows it to be used with many of the dinnerwares &amp; the size is adequate to serve at least 8 10 people.The under plate is something  not found with usual tureen sets which gives it an elegant look but it appears a little overpriced 
May 11,
++  KitchenAid Silicone 12 Cup Muffin Pan, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I used metal muffin pans before, the muffins will never come out without the help of a knife, even the pan was sprayed.  On the other side, I am very satisfied with the Kitchenaid product, becuase beautiful muffins come right out, when turn the pan unside down need to apply cooking spray before baking).  Yes, it did have some plastic smell during baking for the first couple times. After that, no smell at all.   I chose not to pay $5 extra for the rack, still it works well with a cookie tray.   The only negative comment is the unerasble marks left by greaseoil/cooking spray) on the surface. I am not complaining about it, as it states clearly in the instructions, and it does not affect baking.   Overall, I am very satisfied with this product, and I will buy more for my new kitchen.

 ++  Hoover F5912 900 TurboPower 5200 SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge: Kitchen & Housewares ++  this is the best steam cleaner it really gets your carpets looking like new again and I was very surprised that it worked great on old stains as well. I love the attachments for the furniture as a pet owner the attachments and the cleaner work wonders. I especially like the turbo surge button this works for the high traffic areas and I have 2 dogs that like to roll around the carpet to itch there backs and these spots get dirter,so this feature works GREAT for cleaning the deep down areas, makes my carpet's look new again!This is also easy to use to fill the water and empty it too, I am VERY mechianically not smart but this is soooo easy to figure and and use it is a breeze! I LOVE MY  cleaner.

Ironing has become a breeze with this product instead of a dreadful hassle. I iron my shirts every day before work and it shows.

February 25,
 ++  iSi Half Pint Cream Whipper, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I splurged and bought this product for my espressos in the morning. I bought the pint sized model for $35.00. You use one charger each time you open the container up. So if you get the half pint size you will need to stock up on chargers.)   I can't believe how long cream lasts in this thing. I had cream in it for almost two weeks and it was still fresh!   The canned whip cream you buy in the store is too sweet for me, so I just put a little bit of Torino Caramel syrup in with the cream to flavor it. I use it when company comes over for coffee, pie, etc. Why didn't I buy one of these things sooner 
November 30, 2003 ++  iSi Half Pint Cream Whipper, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I got one of these as a x mas gift a few years ago and love it!  It is especially wonderful around the holidays.  I like to make pies and it is great topping on all types of pies.  We also drink a lot of flavored coffee and hot chocolate in the winter its pretty cold here at night) and love to top it off with the cream.  I'm not sure about the flavored syrups, but I just add some flavored coffee creamer international delight or coffee mate) to the container and it makes it taste so good.  It is such a hit at holiday parties that I have to borrow my mom's to keep up with the demand.  It makes a great gift just be sure to get enough off the cartriage containers or you will run out

 ++  Aroma 10&#45;Cup Programmable Rice Cooker &#45; ARC830TC: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love this rice cooker! It replaced one I had for many years,and was sure I would never find another I liked as well.  I was wrong. This rice cooker is absolutely the best. It has replaced the broken one hands down. The rice is perfect every time whether you make 2 servings or serve a crowd, it keeps it warm without ruining it and it is so easy to clean and store.  I would recommend this one to anyone that really likes rice and prepares it often.  
September 11,
 ++  Aroma 10&#45;Cup Programmable Rice Cooker &#45; ARC830TC: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had a Zojirushi NHS 10 and worked fine. I gave it to my sister in law...grin.  Latter I decided I wanted another cooker and just came upon this. It seemed to cheap. I ordered it from Amazon. This thing is a DEAL. We usually cook between 4 6 cups of rice at a time.  It makes perfect rice, if you use the cup at 180cc..  We have 5 kids and been using this 2 4 times a month for last two years.  I like it most of all as it has limited options and cooks only rice.   
August 26,

September 22,
 ++  OXO Good Grips Silicone Oven Mitt with Magnet, Charcoal: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have the Tucker burn guard commercial line, kitchenaid and various designer potholders and I've stopped using them all except these Oxo.  These are great for blocking the heat.  I have smallish female hands and I admit that these mits took some getting used to.  Once I got used to them after the first or second use) I routinely reach for them.  Its to the point that I don't even have the other ones out anymore.  I am here looking to replace my original set of 3 2 mits + 1 potholder) and I was surprised by the negative reviews.  So surprised in fact that I am writing this review.  I swear by them 
July 25,
 ++  Soleus Air FTM 25 10 Inch Oscillating Table Fan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I must agree with everything that has been written previously.  This fan is sturdy, attractive, quiet and well built with all the features one would want or need on a table top fan.  And you can't beat the price.  
May 8,
 ++  La Pavoni PA BURR Burr Coffee Grinder   Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I did a lot of research before purchasing a grinder and I'm glad I took the time to narrow it down to this one.  It has done a great job at a consistant grind, with minimal noise, and tons of grind settings.  Quality 
August 18, 
++  Hoffritz Stainless Steel Gourmet Oil Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a durable sprayer, not a mister.  I went through 3 or 4 misters before finding the Hoffritz sprayers.  Mine are 3 years old and going strong.  The misters, including the expensive stainless steel one, simply do not last very long.  We use a LOT of olive oil and these sprayers have held up well.  They do require a good push.   And you get more olive oil than you would with a mister.

 ++  Wamsutta Even Temperature Standard Pillow: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I don't know how anyone could think that the outlast material isn't working.  ..of course it has been significantly tested and proven that it works.)  At first its cool.  After about 5 minutes depending on the person) outlast starts keeping an even temp..    Now that even temp. may not be as cool as you want   but it never gets much warmer than you are UNLIKE most every other pillow ..even buckwheat pillows which become hotter because of the fabric encasing the buckwheat).  The negatives are however:  1. The outlast material needs to be pretty close to your body to work   and it DOES have a distinctive texture that is a broad weave box pattern and is "stiff" ..though after a few washings it becomes considerably softer).  You might not like this textural feeling.  2. Other than the outlast, the pillow is nothing special.  The support is poor like most pillows, the interesting thing here though is that you can remove the stuffing   and fill it with a material you find acceptable ..if you don't like the standard poly fill), but you will need to do some minor sewing on the seam you opened to remove and replace the filling 
August 27,
++  Cuisinart CPT 140 Electronic Cool Touch 4 Slice Toaster: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Consumer Reports rated this a best pick toaster for the money, and we agree 100%. It toasts beautifully   just what it's supposed to do, right 
November 28,
++  Cuisinart CRC 800 8 Cup Rice Cooker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I got this rice cooker about 8 months ago, and I have probably used it once a week since then. It most certainly makes better rice than I could before cooking in a pot on the stove), but the results are often inconsistent.   Sometimes the rice seems to get dried out and burns at the bottom. I think I need to up the liquid to rice ratio. It just occured to me after reading some other reviews that I may have been drastically overestimating the amount of rice to water because you are supposed to use that little cup that came with the cooker as "1 cup", not 1 real cup. :/   I use the steamer basket to steam shrimp all the time though, and it works fabulously 
December 15,
++  Emile Henry Couleurs 13 by 10 Inch Lasagna Baker, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was suprized when I read the 1 review.I have had mine for 3 years and had no problems,it has been in the dishwasher,put away by my two kids.No cracks no chips,cleans up great 
April 27, 2002 ++  Riedel Vinum Chardonnay/Chablis Wine Glasses, Set of 6: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had heard that the shape of Riedel wine glasses enabled one to maximize the "nose" of a wine.   How very true!  I was amazed how much more of the wine's bouquet was immediately noticeable with these glasses.  And, they feel great in your hands.  I highly recommend them for wine enthusiasts 
May 18, 2003 ++  Vacu Vin Rapid Ice Wine Chiller, Chrome: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love the Rapid Ice Wine Coolers.  I give them for token gifts and use them frequently myself.  They are great for a spure of the moment glass of wine that needs chilling 
June 11,
 ++  Lodge Logic Pre Seasoned 10 1/2 Inch Round Griddle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Great for frying eggs, but I prefer a pan with higher sides for omlets.  Every grilled sandwich I've made on this griddle has come out perfect.  My kids use it to make pancakes and they swear by it.  I've found that pre heating the griddle in the oven first helps it heat more evenly and avoid the hot spots that can occur when cooking on a stove top.  The pre seasoning works great 
August 10,
++  Lodge Logic Pre Seasoned 10 1/2 Inch Round Griddle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Man what a great pancake and a grilled chesse skillet. It's the perfect size for pacakes. I'd give it 10 stars if i could. Love it. 
February 25,
 ++  Calphalon Tri Ply Stainless Steel 8 Quart Stockpot with Glass Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This pan is perfect.  Not too big, nor too small for a perfect soup. For the price, you can't get better.  This pan replaces my Farberware 6 quart, and overall, it isn't any bigger; just holds 2 quarts more.  Love it 
February 26,
 ++  Evco White Marble Collection Rolling Pin: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Found this item on the net when it was  unavailable in stores for Christmas.  Good deal for the money.  Nothing beats marble when making home made ravioli! I dropped it on cement & it did chip,  so be careful where you set it!)  Use the cradle that comes with it

September 17, 
++  Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard Anodized 1 1/2 Quart Saucepan with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This pot is a great deal. I had it for a couple of weeks now and it has been great for cooking, nothing sticks to it and clean up is easy. I love the glass top for see what is in the pot and how it is cooking. Great pot for the money. I find this pot to be just as good as my non stick calphalon if not a little better and the price is lower then the calphalon 
February 20, 2003 ++  FoodSaver 1 Quart Size Bag, Package of 48: Kitchen & Housewares ++  It's excellent if you already have a good foodsaver.  They are thick and good quality bags. It works really well and does keep food fresh.  Only good for small and dry foods though, but they are reuseble to a certain point 
October 9,
 ++  KitchenAid Gourmet Essentials 10 Piece Hard Anodized Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I received this set as a wedding present and have loved using it over the past 4 months. I cook several times a week, mostly for husband and myself, and sometimes for guests. This set has been perfect for my needs, and has performed very well. I follow the care directions handwashing, no metal utensils) and the non stick coating has done very well. I love the glass lids and the cushy handles.  The set includes, as pictured, 1 , 2 , and 3 quart covered saucepans, 6 quart covered stockpot, and 8  and 10 inch French skillets. The skillets don't come with lids, but the two biggest pot lids work well. NOTE: The product descriptions mention an 11 inch saute pan; this is NOT in my set  and is not included according to product features listing or the picture shown. I did feel a need to buy a 12 inch skillet as the one addition to supplement this set. 
April 13,
++  Krups FNC2 Novo 3000 Espresso/Cappuccino/Latte Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The feature's on this machine are what drew me to choose Krups Espresso Maker. The pump instead of the pressure machines was the first draw. The water tank and its size, not having to fill it every day. The fact that the frothing nozzle moved and the location of it. And nobody makes a frothier frother than Krups makes. I love the lattes and I use a large stainless steel milk steaming pitcher. You can make two cups at once. I use it daily and sometimes more than once a day! It makes a great espresso with beautiful crema. I have not had any problems with this machine.Clean after every use. I can't stress this enough and it only takes a minute to wipe the brew area. And do the internal cleaning with solution often or you will get the slow drips of espresso when brewing because of deposit build ups.  Follow cleaning instructions!  I highly recommend this one! Enjoy 
October 10,
 ++  Braun HT600 Impressions Toaster, Brushed Stainless Steel: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My husband, a Jaguar lover), calls this the "E Type of Toasters"!  It is beautifully designed; requires minimal space and is 'simply' sophisticated.  To achieve the "perfect toast" using our old toaster required toasting a slice of bread three times, turning it twice,   now it's one single click. Kitchen appliances wouldn't be hidden away inside the cabinet if they were designed as elegantly as Braun's Impressions Toaster 
August 4,
 ++  Nordic Ware Deluxe Bundt Cake Keeper: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love to have a dinner party with a cake in this case.  It's elegant and gets compliments from all.  I have found it to be sturdy enough, as mine came in one piece and is not broken or cracked.  This is a very nice case.  Cake looks even more tempting 
September 25,
 ++  Krups FDD912 Expert Waffle Maker with Rotary System: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a wonderful appliance and at what a savings!  Mine arrived promptly and in "shipped from the manufacturer" condition.  This is such an improvement over my old waffle maker no matter how much I greased it the waffles always stuck).  The first time I tried it was on my new son in law and I was eager to make a good impression.  A red light indicates the appliance is on and a green light tells you when it's ready to cook.  My first waffle came out beautifully and you know who ate it with great satisfaction and requested another.  Then I screwed up.  You see, if you don't follow directions and forget to rotate the waffle maker your waffle splits in half and can't be put back together again!  Third time I did it right.  Waffle grids slide out easily for cleaning in the dishwasher.  Outside of stainless steel appliance my be cleaned with soap and water or glass cleaner if you prefer.  Handle folds down and therefore the appliance stores easily.  I was too busy to follow the gram instructions in the recipe booklet accompanying the waffle maker and too busy to beat egg whites separately.  So I used my tried and true pancake recipe which turned out great.  In the future I'll be more creative!  Highly recommended for waffle lovers

 ++  Presto 05420 FryDaddy Electric Deep Fryer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This unit does everything it is designed to do.

 ++  West Point Stevens Rockport Full Bed in a Bag: Kitchen & Housewares ++  At $20 and free shipping this is probably the best deal around for people on a buget. Realistly the retail value is not $80 it is around $40. The fabric is not all that soft however with a few washings it should be great. If the thead count bothers you like some other reviewers spend more money don't complain about it when it's plainly listed. An easy way to solve that problem if you are on a tight budget now is to buy it and then later buy a duvet to make the comforter softer. The only reason I deducted a star is because the bed ruffle is very flimsy. It feels like it would tear very easily. This is not a problem for me as I find them annoying but may bother some people. All in all I think it is a great deal

++  Cuisinart DFP 3 Handy Prep 3 Cup Food Processor: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love this product , the processor is small but enough for a home kitchen and it doesn't take up much space. It chops , shred , slice but the bad thing is sometimes when making sticky stuff, the stuff goes under the thing that holds the blade and its extremly hard to get out. The other bad thing is the plastic , everytime I use the processor the smell of what I'm making last in the plastic bowl and won't go away until I make something else. And I did clean it very hard. Overall I do Recommend this product to All

 ++  Joyce Chen 14 Inch Carbon Steel Wok Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had the same wok for four of the five years that I lived in China.  It was made of the same type of carbon steel as this one.  When I came back to the USA last year, I looked all around for this kind of wok and was very happy to find it.  My wife, a native of southwestern China, joined me in the USA this year.  She thoroughly approved of my choice.  And, boy, does she make the best stir fried vegetables in the world.  True, it is heavy, but that is good news because now we have an electric stove and the thick steel helps distribute the heat well. In China we had a gas stove with a huge flame.)  I still don't understand all the rituals involved with "seasoning."  In China I was taught to scrub it hard after cooking with a stainless steel or brass scrubber in hot soapy water, then dry it very well before heating it just a little and rubbing it down with oil we use a paper towel) on the inner surface.  Store it oiled!  Rarely have we had any sticking problems.  A little scrubbing gets the rust right off if you forget to dry and oil, so don't panic!  This is a fairly priced at around $25), good piece of equipment for cooking "real" Chinse food

 ++  KitchenAid KHM5DH 5 Speed Ultra Power Hand Mixer, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The Kitchen Aid hand mixer is actually more than I expected.  It is light weight, easy to use, and has attachments that other mixers don't usually have.  While it is more expensive than your average hand mixer, I definitely feel I got my money's worth.  I have other Kitchen Aid products and they last forever. I have never been disappointed in their performance.  
February 3,
 ++  KitchenAid KHM5DH 5 Speed Ultra Power Hand Mixer, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I purchased this product because I have recently starting baking cookies and stirring cookie dough by hand left my arm and shoulder sore.  I know Kitchenmaid as a quality product name. Instead of the large mixer I opted for this handheld model because I don't have alot of counter top or space.   It is light, easy hold and powerful enough for the toughest chocolate chip cookie dough.  I am happy with it.   I was also happy with the delivery of the product...it arrived within the week and was well package to prevent damage

 ++  Commuter, Double Shot, Stainless Steel French Press, Chrome: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Great invention!   I drink mostly loose teas, gave up coffee some time ago.   Because of work and being "Mom", I spend a lot of time in my car.  I have tried several travel presses and most of them don't trap all of the leaves under the press, especially leaves that unroll as they steep.  This is the most practical travel mug that I've ever seen and the storage compartment is absolutely great for carrying extra loose tea for those all day meetings.  I ordered one for my desk and one for those long car trips 
January 7,
 ++  Commuter, Double Shot, Stainless Steel French Press, Chrome: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was thinking about a way to make coffee at work where there was no coffee machine easily accessable. I thought a french press would be a great idea, but all of them seemed to be made of glass and I didn't want to leave my press laying around where I work we share space with other companies so people come and go). With this mug all I have to do is heat up some hot water in the microwave and throw it in with the coffee or tea and maybe some sugar). Wait a bit, push down the press and drink. The whole mug is well made out of metal and high quality plastic and rubber. The bottom stores a cannister which holds enough coffee or tea for another cup or two and the seal is tight enough to keep it fresh.   I read another review of the mug somewhere and they complained about getting coffee grinds coming through. Well let me say this mug has a double filter, one on the plunger part of the press and one on the lid where you drink or pour from. Coffee used for french press preperation is supposed to be a coarse grind. I think that person tried using store bought ground coffee or just didn't know any better and put finely ground coffee in. The mug will do a pretty good job even with coffee like that, but some is bound to get through that way and you get a muddy cup besides the point so use coffee made for french press brewing not finely ground coffee and you will love this mug

++  Lodge Original Finish 6 Quart Cast Iron Camp Dutch Oven: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The effectiveness of this dutch oven lies in its design which served chuck wagons a century ago and campers today!  Cast Iron is ALWAYS a good value for the money and it's indestructable I'm still using my mother's Lodge skillet that she got for a wedding gift in 1954). This dutch oven, designed specifically for the camp or fireplace cook, goes from the fire to the table with ease. It stews and bakes beautifully   get a dutch oven cookbook and learn how to make campfire biscuits as well as those stews and chilis! Also makes a fabulous wedding, shower, or housewarming gift. Forget expensive wedding registries   buy the bride a lodge dutch oven and skillet. She'll hand them down to the next generation. Every camper can use this and so can every backyard griller. Highly recommend!

When my daughter visits, she says, &quot;I'd like a glass of Brita water!&quot; :

 ++  Leifheit Pro Line Stainless Steel Egg Slicer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I struggled through many pages of  product reviews and descriptions before I finally decided to purchase this particular brand.  Why?  Because I didn't have a clue on which brand was good or bad, many of the reviews for mushroom/egg slicers were mixed, so I took a stab in the dark, and came up a winner!!  This is a great product, stores easily, and works well.  The curve where you put the mushroom or egg) is just the right size and is just a wonderful time saver!  I love it

++  Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick 10 Piece Cookware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Honestly... I do not, for the likes of me, understand why anyone would give this cookware a bad review.  It appears that those who have, either can't read or didn't bother.  We have had our set of Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick for several months, and everyone in the family mom, dad, two teenage sons) uses them.  We use and wash them as directed.  Also, we don't use any of the "Pam" type sprays.  So far they still look great and the foods cooked in them are delicious

The cover handle gets very hot in use but this is to be expected as it is metal. The saucepan handle is quite narrow and if wet, or greasy, could be annoying to handle when draining the pan although I have not had this problem with any of the pans in this range).

April 26, 2003 ++  Farberware Classic 10 Inch Frypan with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have owned this skillet for 25 years and it's still going strong, even with constant use.  Still looks great, too.  It's a good size, easy to clean and useful for many purposes.  The aluminum core spreads the heat well.  This is a great value for the price

 ++  Pyrex Programmable Timer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a great device and has multiple settings to keep tasks on track.  Very full featured and easy to use 
August 29,
 ++  Pyrex Programmable Timer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have bought this timer numerous times, and, after a few years, after it falls into a pot of soup or something, I go buy another. Reasons: a) the programmable timer which allows you to time several dishes simultaneously. b) Sturdiness. Its magnet does not stay glued to the back forever, but otherwise it's durable for an everyday electronic gadget   you should get several years of use out of it. c) It's one of the only timers I can find   and I look at big box stores, major discount stores, the supermarket, etc.   that allow you to time dishes longer than an hour or 99 minutes. This is important for pot roast, big chickens, turkeys, unusual dishes that simmer overnight, and so on.   I recently bought it at Amazon because the big box store where I used to get it, now only carries from Pyrex a much more complex version which you don't need for everyday cooking.

 ++  Pyrex Programmable Timer: Kitchen & Housewares ++  In my opinion this is the best kitchen timer out there!    It has FOUR separate programmable digital timers that can count up and/or down   each with their own alarm sound.  It also has a regular clock setting.  Plus, you can either plop it on the fume hood using the magnet on the back of it, clip it to your apron using the clip or set it on the counter using it's support stand.  Oh, and did I mention how small it is?...just another nice feature!   So yeah, no more having to set the oven timer, the microwave timer and my watch timer in order to keep track of all the various foods cooking at the same time.  Not only do I use this timer in the kitchen constantly I also use it for numerous other things too.  It's the "Time Out" timer for the kids, a ten minute reminder when I need to get us all out of the house...you name it!  My Mother owns this same timer and is the one that originally introduced me to it, thank heavens!  I can't imagine running a kitchen without this hard to find item.  If you check out Bed, Bath & Beyond you'll see they don't have anything with FOUR programmable timers.  Long story short...if you purchase this timer I promise you will NOT be disappointed.

 ++  Le Creuset 3 1/2 Quart Buffet Casserole, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other products. Le Creuset casts these cooking vessels from molten iron poured in sand moulds that are used only once. For this reason, one pot may look like another, but each is unique in its own way.   Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently. It is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat. However, there are exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay. Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This heat retention helps your food stay warm while serving. Beware; iron tends to be heavy so are these cooking vessels.   Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain your cooking vessel. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood.   The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the buffet casserole specifically. The buffet casseroles are one of the most versatile pieces in the Le Creuset lineup.  Use this pan as a saut� pan, a roasting pan, for poaching, or as a shallow braiser.  The 3.5 quart capacity can is plenty of space when it comes to casseroles, so consider your recipes when determining the size you need. The buffet casserole tends to do best if at least three quarters full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with the evenly dispersed heat in the pot.   With a large flat bottom that curves up this pan resembles a curved sided saute pan the only thing missing would be a long handle. The tight fitting lid is mostly flat with curved sides. This lid seals in heat, moisture, and flavors and can be used to hold your meat while you are making a sauce from the drippings. Its shape and design makes this an extremely versatile pan.   I tend to use this pot for basic dishes like smothered pork chops more than anything else. But once you get past the basic functionality that lends itself to recipes such as paella, frittatas, deep dish pizza, and casseroles, you can really open up the possibilities.  Keep in mind this is a 3.5 quart pan, feeding two out if it is ridiculous unless you want leftovers. It is probably the perfect size for a family of four in most cases.  Try baking pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding for when you need to please many guests, poaching fish, or Mac and Cheese. The possibilities almost seem endless.   One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of. PROS:  Extremely versatile  Efficient absorption and distribution of heat  Hygienic enamel cooking surface  Does not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors  Easy to clean when not abused or misused  Can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table  Can easily last a lifetime   CONS:  Its heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 12.25 pounds

 ++  Totally Bamboo Hana Cutting Board: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've owned this board for a year now.  Pros  light weight, you can use very sharp knives on and not get much indentation on the board, compact.  Cons  well it can be a con that it is light weight since if you are trying to cut a larger item it might shift, but honestly, if you just get a cutting board that is larger you'd have the perfect cutting board 
July 30, 2003 ++  Oneida Cocktail Shaker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am giving this 4 stars rather than 5 simply because I do not like the way this just pulls on and off. I've never purchased a shaker before though, but I would appreciate one the screws off and on so the top is certain to be on every time! Other than that..it's very sleek and the strainer in the top is a plus 
August 13, 2002 ++  Oneida Cocktail Shaker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have used this jigger several times a week since I got it back in November, and I think it's great.  I often make a second round with it.  It is difficult to remove the top with the jigger on, but otherwise it comes off fine as long as you open it up right after you make and pour a round of drinks

 ++  Progressive International Vegetable/French Fry Cutter: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This was a simple and easy to use product.  I didn't even have to read the directions on how to remove the blades.  The only downfall is that you can't use very big vegetables.  I use it to make home made french fries.  I had to cut the potato in order for it to fit in the cutter.  Aside from that it's a great product

 ++  Black & Decker D2030 Auto Off Digital Advantage Iron: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I had a Panasonic teflon coated iron before this.  I didn't have any idea how much easier ironing could be   teflon is way overrated!  Don't get me wrong, I still HATE ironing, but at least now its over a lot faster.  Plus, the iron is always at the right temperature for whatever I'm ironing, and its easy to fill with water.  The only thing I'd like is a retractable cord, but it isn't a real cause for complaint 
November 21,
 ++  Black & Decker D2030 Auto Off Digital Advantage Iron: Kitchen & Housewares ++  After reading a recommendation from Consumer Reports I was excited to see this iron for less that the suggested price.  In two days it arrived and I am very pleased with this iron.  Although it is a bit heavier than my old one, the results were great.  No tax?  No shipping?  No parking     the best way to shop

The box is a little cheap feeling and looking, but allows for a great storage within a drawer or cabinet.

 ++  Vacu Vin Wine Saver Gift Pack, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought my Vacu Vin set about 4 years ago and it's still working perfectly.  It's so easy to use and it does preserve the wine flavor for at least a few days.  We no longer have to finish a whole bottle in one sitting or risk a spoiled wine.  I've recommended it to a few of my friends and they all say they can't live without it now.  Few things of note:   Even with Vacu Vin, the wine will start to change flavor if kept over a week.   You do need to pump a lot more than the instruction indicates.  Keep pumping until you feel a strong resistance.   Vacu Vin cannot be used for wines with fizz such as Vino Verde, Champagne, etc).  The reduced pressure will suck the gas out of the wine and make it flat very quickly.   It's better to keep the bottle upright so there's no pressure on the rubber stopper It does not need to stay moist like a cork).  Its purpose is to keep a leftover wine until you finish it, and it does that quite well 
February 4,
 ++  Vacu Vin Wine Saver Gift Pack, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  product works as described, keeping red and white wines for longer than their normal corked shelf life.  case could be a bit more substantial with a higher cosmetic appeal

May 11,
++  Quadro 16&#45;pc&#46; Dinnerware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I just moved into my new place and I wanted a new set of dishes that were simple but unique and this set was perfect.  Just like past reviews have stated, these pieces are a perfect size.  The bowls are awesome cereal bowls, the dinner plates are large, the salad plates are perfect for salad or a sandwich w/ chips and the coffee cups are used every morning for my cup of joe.  I bought a second set to make sure I had plenty for when friends came over for dinner.  Speaking of friends over for dinner, on the two occasions that I have had friends over for dinner since I bought the set, people always compliment the pieces.  I am very happy with my purchase 
September 28, 
++  Quadro 16&#45;pc&#46; Dinnerware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I cant say enough about this set.  The cups are the perfect hot beverage size.  The dinner plates are big enough for any meal and I love the square shape.  They are versitle and fit any style.  They also fit perfectly in the dishwasher and they set straight up and do not fall over so I never need to re wash.  The salad plates are big enough for salads, desserts, appetizers or condiments.  Bowls are great too

 ++  New Improved Brown Ecopad, the Refillable Coffee Filter for the Senseo: Kitchen & Housewares ++  After reading the reviews, I decided to try these, since I wasn't too thrilled with either the cost or quality of the senseo pods. After getting my three sets in the mail, I went to my grocery store, bought the Starbucks Sumatra whole beans, ground them to expresso grind, and went to try the ecopads. I followed the instructions, put the ecopad in the machine perfect fit), hit the 8oz button, and wa   la! I would challenge anyone to tell the difference between the stuff you pay $3.50 a cup for at Starbucks. I'm definately hooked. I can't see how other reviewers have had problems with these. They are easy to fill, and fit perfectly in the machine. They are a bit messy to clean up, but its a fair trade off for the awesome coffee and the cost savings over the pods or actually going to starbucks. I would estimate I will get 50 60 cups out of a $6 store bought bag of coffee. Basically, one heaping teaspoon fills up the ecopad perfectly. Also I would estimate getting hundreds of uses out of each ecopad   they seem very durable. I am looking forward to trying different coffee's with these. Well worth the tiny investment

 ++  Calphalon Triply Stainless 2 1/2 Quart Shallow Saucepan with Glass Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love to cook, and own several different brands of cookware, All Clad, Cuisinart, and Calaphone.  This sauce pan didn't disappoint me.  I love it!!  The pan has a wider bottom than most 2 or 2 1/2 quart pans.  This is great if you need to saute onions or peppers at the beginning of a sauce, or if you need a little extra room to stir something.  I am very, very happy with this

++  Lodge Pro Logic Pre Seasoned 8 Inch Skillet: Kitchen & Housewares ++  It's just the right size for sauteing veggies and meat for one.  Cooks evenly and requires little cleanup.  The preseasoning takes the guesswork out of initially readying castiron cookware for use.  Lodge Pro Logic properly packaged and sent my merchandise in record time. I would definitly buy from them again and recommend them to my friends 
December 12, 2002 ++  KitchenAid FVSP Fruit and Vegetable Strainer Parts for Food Grinder: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The attachments that are available for KitchenAid mixers are worth their weight in gold. This is the most recent attachment I've purchased for my mixer. I can't tell you how much time was saved when making apple butter and apple relish for the holiday season. This time of year, saving time is a good thing when there doesn't seem to be enough time for everything on your LISTS!!! Happy Holidays

 ++  Delonghi BG24 Perfecto Indoor Grill: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have had my grill for a week, we've cooked lean steaks on it, pork chops, and the other night we cooked hamburgers on it.  This is my first indoor grill so when one review mentioned the "George Foreman" grill was a bit faster, I was amazed I thought the Delonghi cooked pretty fast!!  Clean up was really easy and one MUST remember to preheat it.  I gather some have not.  And as to smoking I haven't had any but then I buy lean meats and put water in the bottom if I think the food will drip a lot of fat.  Fat dripping into the large tray in the bottom is what burns and causes the smoke.  I've only used water once, with the hamburgers no smoking).  This really is a great grill and large enough to be more than satisfying actual cooking space is 15"x11").  Ease and comfort of use is amazing.  I highly recommend it! 
November 10, 2002 ++  Kaiser Bakeware Noblesse 7 Inch Nonstick Springform Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I got this pan for making cheesecakes in a 5 quart round crock pot.  There are recipes for these on southernfood.about.com in the crock pot section.)  This a good pan for this type of recipe!  It's an unusual size, more than mini but less than full size.  It's a great size for one or two people.  Standard recipes and pan sizes always make waaaaay too much for the small household.)   I generally like Kaiser products.  Very good German engineered quality!  The BMW of bakeware.  No leaks, excellent materials, spring is excellent.  I had some other springform pans that were useless and they went into the trash.  Not so Kaiser.  Kaiser pans are keepers!  They are worth the little bit of extra money compared to other brands.  America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated also endorses Kaiser as the best springform pan choice...and they really know how to evaluate and test equipment and cookware

 ++  Calphalon Tri Ply Collector's Edition 12 Inch Everyday Pan with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I just finished washing this pan, which I choose to use at an increasing rate. It washes up with ease, who needs non stick? Looks beautiful, more importantly, I love cooking in it. Perfect size! The only problem is, I won't let the men in the household use it, hmmm 
January 13,
 ++  Calphalon Tri Ply Collector's Edition 12 Inch Everyday Pan with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I purchased a custom collection of Calphalon tri ply pieces in the past six months, starting with smaller pans and working my way up. I am so IN LOVE with them.  This everyday pan is a workhorse and you simply cannot beat the ease of cleaning.  Once you get used to it, cleaning the stainless versus nonstick) is just as easy   and better because it is dishwasher safe.  Stainless versus nonstick is now my preference virtually all of the time.  For skillet chicken, this is the absolute best you can do for a perfectly browned end result.  I have one piece of All Clad and I can tell you honestly that I PREFER the Calphalon tri ply to it   though ALL Clad is definitely exceptional.  You will not regret this purchase.

 ++  Cuisinart DCG 12BC Grind Central Coffee Grinder: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this grinder for flax seed and it works wonderfully. What I love most is that after you grind what you need you can place the tight sealing lid that comes with it on and put in right into the fridge. Nice look, great function and very clean machine. 
June 17,
 ++  Cuisinart DCG 12BC Grind Central Coffee Grinder: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I purchased the Cuisinart grinder from Amazon based upon customer reviews just over two years ago after trying two cheaper $20 ish models picked up at local discount stores.  Motors on one of the cheaper grinders locked up in short order; the second lasted longer but the blades rusted after only 2 3 months in a storage building. The motor on the Cuisinart is still going strong, but I had to trash it today.  I have to admit that the blades did seem to be a bit duller after grinding enough beans to make 1 3 pots of coffee per day for two years straight,  but that's to be expected with a blade grinder.  The on/off button broke about 2 months ago; then, last week, the blade housing wore out and broke off while grinding my favorite John Conti beans.  Others have stated that this grinder is less messy than some of the other models, but grinding coffee is a messy undertaking and a necessary evil to get the freshest coffee!  If I don't try a higher quality burr grinder, I may get another one of these!

++  Bodum Eileen 4 Cup Coffee Press: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I purchased this French press for my husband several weeks ago and I love it. Happy with the regular coffee maker, I had little interest in the item until I saw it in action for the first time. It's so easy to use and the flavor of the coffee is much smoother. It's also beautiful. I purchased two matching cups at the same time and they remind me of Russian tea glasses   a collecting favorite of mine. I highly recommend this all around good buy 
May 7,
++  Bodum Eileen 4 Cup Coffee Press: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a decent unit.  For those who don't take the time to read or can't understand what they read the product listing states the scoop included is for a 4 ounce cup4 x 4 is 16).  The usual sold in the US coffeemaker is a 4 6 ounces per cup capacity.  Coffee instructions say usually measures are for a 6 ounce cup.  A cup is not what you use or the standard liquid 8 ounce cup.  Most advertised 10 and 12 cup coffeemakers hold the same total amount in the carafe. The manufacturer calcultaes what will sell.  This has been going on since I bought my first coffeemaker 30 years ago. Caveat emptor!

 ++  West Bend 40053 Triple Timer with Clock, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The Model 40053 is a good effort, but misses the mark compared to the now discontinued West Bend Model 40032 Triple Timer, sold in the 1980s and 1990s.  I don't need a real time clock, nor a stopwatch in a kitchen timer, because they just complicate the device.   Water resistance;  distinctive alarms for each channel;  superbright blinking LED secondary alarm indicator for loud environments;  blinking LCD indicator for each active timing channel;  shirt pocket size, countertop stability;  single hand programmability, and  memory recall for easy repeat timing     that's what I'd like to see in an improved version of the 40032.  Perhaps customer pressure can get West Bend to bring something like that to the market
