++  All Clad Stainless Steel All Purpose Steamer with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love this steamer because it fits in All Clad sauce pans from 2 to 4 quarts.  The other version with the long handle doesn't fit the 2 quart.  Works beautifully.  Easy to care for dishwasher safe).
July 7, 2000 ++  Amco 4 Piece Stainless Steel Measuring Cup Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  If you love to prepare food, these measuring cups are for you. They are very well made and are fairly heavy. No cheap metal here. They feel good in your hand. If cooking is as much of an art as a necessity to you, these  will make an excellent addition to your kitchen

 ++  Juan Valdez JVPM1W Pod Coffee Brewing System with 90 Free Coffee Pods: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This maker is the better of the two pod coffee machines I had. It is easy to make your own pods that work very well and you have much better coffee due to fresh grind. My problem was that the part that catches when you close the lid broke. It probably was mostly my fault but it is made of plastic unlike the metal one on the other pod maker I have. That is why the other one still works and the Juan Valdez is broken. IF you are careful not to overfill your homemade pods you'd probably never have a problem with it. Just be careful in closing it and don't force it

 ++  Juan Valdez JVPM1W Pod Coffee Brewing System with 90 Free Coffee Pods: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I got this for Christmas over a year ago, and it still works great!  I use it most every morning.  The coffee quality isn't as good as my drip maker   no pod coffee maker can ever measure up to a drip maker   but it's very easy to brew just one cup and with no cleanup except to remove the used pod!).  I agree with the other reviewer that the Juan Valdez coffee pods come in excessive packaging individually wrapped pods inside a cardboard box), plus my grocery store doesn't carry them.  Any brand pod can be used with this coffee maker.  I use whatever's cheapest, usually the Senseo Douwe Egberts.  I buy either the dark roast or the vanilla flavored.  I prefer strong coffee, but even the dark roast pods aren't strong enough for me.  I wish I had the black colored machine because the white shows every single coffee stain

 ++  Fiesta Plum 471 1 Quart Pasta Bowl: Kitchen & Housewares ++  When all you're having is a big bowl of chunky soup for lunch or oatmeal for breakfast, this bowl goes great in the microwave and on to the sofa with you.  So many times one has to be careful microwaving a hearty portion of soup or oatmeal in a regular sized bowl, because it will boil over.  How much fun is that to clean up your microwave carousel before you can eat?    But this bowl is big enough to handle the bubbling.  Just take a kitchen towel under it against the heat and you will be cozy in your terrycloth robe on the couch for some nice potato ing

++  Kitchenaid Wire Sled With 12 Cup Muffin Pan, Silicone, Blue: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've used my pan twice before reviewing. The first time was corn muffins and they came out really well. They muffins popped out with ease.  The second time I made lemon cupcake with white chocolate chips, and it was harder. The pan was hard to transport to the oven full of batter. Halfway through baking, the batter drips onto the oven floor, causing me to put a muffin tin under the pan. When baked and cooled, the cupcakes broke while popping out

++  Cuisinart CPT 70 Classic Style Toaster: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I dont think it was as bad as the reviews imply.  I've had mine about 6 months now and it still works fine, the only complaint I have is about the settings as one person said it can be the exact same on both sides and yet one side will "burn" and one be "underdone".  I just adjusted these and turned them so they both cook whatever I'm making right, even though it is off by one number compared to the other side.  So thats a fluke for sure which would make it worth buying one without any problems, but frankly I've yet to find such a toaster.  Other then that I've had no problems with this one, I love the look and style of it as well it is so cute and practical other then the above problem.  I would recommend this toaster but as I got it as a gift I probably wouldnt spend the $50 but would gladly pay $30 for it.  I dont think you can really find a better toaster I've done the cheap kmart specials and frankly those dont last as long as this has without much worse problems or burning.

 ++  Calphalon Contemporary Stainless Special Value 16 1/2 Inch Roaster with Nonstick Roasting Rack: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I researched many roaster pans before I settled on this and am I glad I did. It offers a truly stovetop worthy construction, no bending or warping, a great v rack, and superb heat distribution. The handles are comfortable and the pan fits perfectly in the oven. Compared to the AllClad, it is less expensive and better performance. A well thought out pan
March 19,
 ++  Lodge Pro Logic Pre Seasoned 12 Inch Skillet: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love the way cast iron cooks.  Not to mention it is so nice to spend less on something that lasts longer and is easier to clean up!  I do have problems lifting things sometimes, but this is about the same amount of work as the non stick pans that I used to have, although slightly heavier, the handles are ergonomic and the loop on the other side of the handle compensates by making a balanced lifting motion easier.
June 8,
 ++  Chicago Cutlery Insignia Steel 12 Piece Knife Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Lisa S from Ohio complains that the knives rust very easily and that this is a buyer beware item.  This is not a buyer beware item. This is an item that requires some knowledge about use and care of carbon steel knives. Carbon steel is an alloy which allows one to hone a very keen edge and it is used for very fine cutting tools in general. It does rust very easily and should always be dried after washing, and even wiped with a little olive oil. These knives cannot be left sitting in dishwater, and they should never be run through a dishwasher. If you want to throw your kitchen knives into a dishwasher, buy cheap stainless steel ones
May 21,
++  Chicago Cutlery Insignia Steel 12 Piece Knife Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have recived serveral comments on how good these knifes look. I am in fact very pleased with the way they look, but even more important is how well they perform. They cut wonderfully for me at least, but I'm used to cheapy knifes). Yes they will in fact rust, although I haven't had this problem with my set had them for about four months now) because I only handwash them and dry them immediately.  One steak knife found it's way into the dishwasher and sure enough it came out with a little rust spot, this was easily removed with a little steel wool.  You just have to weight the benefits of the all metal knifes to those that are wood handled or plastic

++  Holmes HACP9 Oscilllating Clip Fan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This little fan does just what I need it for. A bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk. It clips on very well. I even tried it on a 1/2 inch overhang and it stayed on. I would reccomend 3/4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation. That oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful. My reason for no 5 stars is the vibration. There is too much especially on high speed. This could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip. It doesn't bother me but might others. The cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch. I needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan. This was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt. All in all very good for my uses. If you need just a bit of air in a tight space this one's for you

 ++  Calphalon Commercial Hard Anodized 12 Quart Stockpot with Lid: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love all my calphalon pots, pans, and bakeware.  Best set I have every owned or used.  Even heat, easy clean up, I have never made reductions as easily as I have in these pots & pans.  The fact that you can get these on special with great pricing puts it over the top.  I paid $26.57 for this after discounts and free shipping

 ++  Braun MR430HC/AC Multiquick Deluxe Hand Blender & Chopper: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this hand blender for making split pea soup.  Using the hand blender made the soup so much creamier.  My husband has Diabetes 2 and he loves his sweets.  I make him the instant, no sugar, no fat pudding and by using the hand blender it becomes very creamy and so much more palatable.  So far the blender is working just great

 ++  Cuisinart Santoku 7 Inch Fine Edge Knife: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This knife has a lot to offer as far as I'm concerned.  I'm not looking for a highlife line of knives...because I have a family  all of which do not respect special care of important knives.  I want a knife that cuts well..thats sturdy...and can take some abuse like being in water or not being  cleaned right away.  I do not buy wood handles anymore either...because too  many times the knife goes in the water or is not cleaned promptly. I also want one that will stay sanitary...or can be sanitized.  This santuko by Cuisinart fits the bill for me. The weight is excellent for me...I have a large hand for a woman...and some health issues for which I prefere a lighter handling knife that cuts without a lot of pressure...and will not make my wrist ache when used .  Cuts like a dream through all the fruits and veggies  I tried it on.  Washed up  easy and quick...dried quick too.  I paid only a little bitty amount for this very  big hearted knife.  I recommend it for all real cooks out there... that also have family using your stuff

++  Taylor Two Event Digital Timer/Clock: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a pretty good timer with two timing capability, but the only complaint I have with it is that you have to push a minimum of four different buttons just to stop the timer and get it to stop the led screen from flashing.  However, it has very nifty features and the sound of the timer is not too irritating.  Also, the five minute warning is very useful

September 6, 2001 ++  OXO Steel 59491 Ladle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Ok, cmon now.  It's a ladle and works well.  I own the extire oxo steel line and am pleased with all the products under this line.  They all perform their function well and with style.  And they are also very comfortable to use thanks to the famous oxo nonslip rubber handle/fins

++  Carry&#45;On Satin 20&#45;pc&#46; Flatware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I adore this flatware! The weight, the clean lines, and beautiful shape! However, it only gets 4 stars because the knives develop rust spots when put in the dishwasher. To prevent rusting, I have to hand wash them. Admittedly, it's inconvenient and not something everyone wants to do. The spoons and forks seem to do just fine in the dishwasher so I don't know what's wrong with the knives. I'm assuming they're made differently. Gourmet Settings, the manufacturer, does have a warranty on the flatware so if you buy this set you may want to, or have to, make use of this
March 27, 2003 ++  Carry&#45;On Satin 20&#45;pc&#46; Flatware Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I've had my set for about a year a half.  I haven't had one speck of rust   I wonder if they had a bad batch at some point??  I would definately take them back.  I can see how they'd be too big/heavy for kids   but for adults they're great.  Fit the contours of your mouth very nicely.  I use mine with Fiestaware and they look great together

++  KitchenAid All Purpose Scraper, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I bought this for all sorts of uses in the kitchen and am very happy with the quality of the product. Kitchenaid consistently produces quality products. I use it when making bread to scrape it off the board to prevent sticking, for dividing the dough for rolls and loaves. Overall I'm very pleased with it
April 28,
 ++  MIU France Bamboo Mini Butcher Board: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I absolutely love this cutting board.  It works well with most knives don't use the serrated knives with tiny teeth).  The board is very forgiving with repeated cutting.  They are very heavy and very attractive.  The only complaint I have is the paper packaging stuck to the board.  I've bought 3 of these and I couldn't get all of the "glue" off any of the boards.  I eventually just put the oil on the boards to protect them and that somehow helped get most of the sticky residue off.  MIU France really needs to use something that will not permanently stick to the boards.  I'd give it a 5 star if the sticky residue and paper came off easily
October 27, 2002 ++  Riedel Pannonia Decanter: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This is a beautiful piece of glassware that adds a touch of class to any table. However...and this is a significant however...a good decanter should be as broad as possible at the level at which a full bottle of wine will fill it. The idea is to have as large an air to wine interface as possible, so as to let as much wine as possible &quot;breathe&quot;. This of course is not terribly important for whites and better reds, but younger red wines benefit considerably from being decanted for an hour before they are drunk. Therefore, I suggest this decanter be reserved for whites and reds that are &quot;ready&quot;

 ++  PUR  Ultimate Slim Design Water Pitcher: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I could definitely tell a difference in the taste of my water, and hopefully that means it's chlorine free, but I haven't had it tested. However, it must be doing its job because the filter itself only lasts about a month! I think that its life span just depends on how bad your water is. It works better that my old Brita filter, which I could tell wasn't working because my water still smelled like chlorine with that one. That being said, I would buy the PUR pitcher over again if given the choice

 ++  Rival 64451LD C 6.5 Quart Round Slow Cooker with Bonus Little Dipper Slow Cooker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have never owned a crock pot before, so I was a little apprehensive.  I did a lot of research and finally settled on this item because of size, price and shape of the unit.  I am extremely happy with the product.  It is perferct for a first time user   not too complicated, but has eveything you need to make the most basic or more complicated recepies.  It did not smell at all on first use many pots have that reputation).  It is very attractive and fits nicely on my countertop.  The inner ceremic part is very sturdy and cleans up very easily.  I do recommend for first time users that you purchase one good cookbook many are carried on Amazon).  I purchased several, and my favorite so far is "The Gormet Slow Cooker"  I have tried several recepies and they were all perfect.  I am converted to crock pot cooking!!

 ++  Lodge Original Finish Pro Grid/Iron Griddle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  i was looking for a non non stick surface griddle to cook pancakes on and i got so much more.  my husband and i are concerned about the effects of dupont coatings on our children's long term health he is a doctor) so i have been searching for a stainless griddle for ages. finally, i happened upon cast iron as an option.  i never really understood the benefits of cast iron and it seemed so high maintenance    all the seasoning involved.  i was also reluctant to use it because you are not supposed to really scrub it clean which goes against my personality.  plus, where would i store my seasoned not so clean griddle when i was not using it.  well, the thing is ... when am i not using it? and when i am not i store it in my oven)  i use it almost every day.  the grill side works great for bacon, salmon, hamburgers, chicken  anything when i don't feel like firing up the grill.  so far everything turns out perfect, not too dry.  the griddle side is great for pancakes and eggs and truly non stick without the chemicals of a coating to worry about.  The bottom line is...I love this product more than any other kitchen item since my kitchen aid mixer another love of mine).  i plan to buy more as gifts for all my family and friends with gas stoves I am not sure how well it works with electric eyes).  truly a kitchen basic.  if you are thinking of getting one, you should

 ++  Sharper Image "Bright As Day!" Library Lamp   Cherry Finish Wood Stem SI503CHR): Kitchen & Housewares ++  I suspected that a daylight spectrum lamp might be a complete hoax.  I work in an interior office with no view of natural light.  That's 8 10 hours a day in a room with flourescent lighting!  When I would come in, I would feel foggy and depressed and unmotivated.  When I would leave, I would feel blinded by the light outside and out of sorts.  So I bought this lamp on a whim from a Sharper Image Store.  It comes with a brushed steel lampshade, but the store also gave me a white translucent vinyl shade which is what I wound up using.  The light is softly diffused around my workspace.  I can increase or decrease the intensity of the light using the dimmer dial.  And honestly, whether it's psychological or whatever, I feel SO much better since I plugged this thing in!  I am perky, motivated and when I walk outside, I don't feel shocked anymore.  I would recommend this lamp to anyone who works lengthy hours indoors without natural light.  Employers, BUY THIS FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES IT'S A GODSEND AND IT LOOKS COOL TOO

++  Farberware 3 Piece Rubberized Handle Set: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Twenty bucks for three name brand skillets is a great price.  They are not part of Farberware's higher end line obviously from the price.  any educated consumer will recognize and admit this.)  The bottom line is that they do what they're supposed to do.  We are replacing a very heavy Revereware Non stick pan my wife bought 1.5 years ago.  The teflon wa flaking off.  She had paid $45 for it.  we decided that most of the supermarket non stick frying pans we've had over the years lasted 1 2 years and they were usually $13 20.  This Farberware set is a great value

++  Simply Calphalon Nonstick Aluminum 13 Inch Grill Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have owned my fair share of indoor grills, from a Foreman grill to a really heavy grill pan which I ordered through Amazon. Not too long ago I recently acquired the Calphalon grill pan because my Foreman grill is too small if I want to cook a piece of meat and some vegetables at the same time. Plus the black coating on my Foreman grill is wearing out. So I bought the Calphalon grill pan when it was on sale at a local department store. I haven't been able to get enough of it. It is so easy to clean even when I had cooked a piece of meat that was marinated in Italian dressing or in my own concoction of ground fennel seed, garlic, shallots, and extra virgin olive oil. The marinade will of course stick to the grill which is expected however cleaning it off the grill pan was so much easier than my last grill pan which was heavy and difficult to clean because it wasn't non stick. I also like using the Calphalon grill pan because I can cook both the meat and vegetable say asparagus) at the same time. The results are fabulous. I get those wonderful grill marks and grill taste. Although it is a bit big for this apartment dweller, I still consider this grill pan the best of all the indoor grills I have owned. Well worth the money too
September 13,
 ++  Farberware Generations Triple Pack, Silver: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I'm thoroughly impressed by this set of inexpensive skillets: each of the three are the right size for my use:  Small skillet for nice round pancakes, larger skillet for general stir fry, the griddle for bacon, eggs and toasting bread with more than enough real estate to cook two of three at the same time   could have crammed in the bacon but that releases too much fat).    The best part about this entire set is that it cleans up so well   i'm coming from some lousy Tefal remember when they were actually a premium brand with good quality? those times have long gone) which stained really badly, not to mention the nonstick flaking off after a couple uses.  I've even tried some of the el cheapo calphalons another premium brand going downhill) from amazon and they chip and wear fast right out of the box.  I'm now a convert to farberwear   they are inexpensive and has really held up to the test of time this is in reference to my stainless steel set I purchased right after college 10 years ago   they're still going strong and is testament to their quality even if they don't have the name or pricing to show for it).

 ++  Bodum 5500 03USA Ibis Cordless Electric Water Kettle, White: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Have had it for three years but haven't used it much. The times I have used it, it has worked very well.  Dislikes: Cant tell when it is done boiling the water. There is no indicator. The only way is to hear the switch click from on to off.  Also, there is a min and max line for the amount of water needed to use. However, very hard to see so I used a Sharpee to highlight on the outside. Would be nice if it had cup indicator markings or other markings to tell you how much water you are boiling

++  VillaWare V5955  Grand Wrap Tortilla and Flatbread Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have used this griddle so much I have worn it out and am now going to buy another one.  I have great results making flour tortillas with it.  I always use the quaker flour torilla mix from wal mart.    Every now and then I have a blow up, but once you learn the proper technique for flattening the bread it's really easy, and much faster and easier than rolling them out by hand.

 ++  Danby Countertop Dishwasher   DDW396W: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We needed a small countertop dishwasher for our rec room, and after a few months of use, I can say this one is working out very well.  It shipped quickly, with no damage the box was pretty tattered, but the packing material and the actual dishwasher were fine). It's large for a countertop device, certainly bigger than most microwaves. Be sure to measure your available space, especially clearance to any cabinets above your installation site.  I hit some minor bumps getting it installed. The dishwasher hose nozzle is supposed to connect to your kitchen faucet using a threaded  quick connect coupler included in the box. The coupler is supposed to screw onto the end of the faucet, but the faucet on that sink was a removeable spray handle on a long hose. There's no way for the included adapter to hook up to this, so I wound up having to install a new faucet this isn't as bad as it sounds, as we were planning to replace the old one anyway).  I brought the quick connect adapter to the hardware store with me to be sure it would fit the threads on the new faucet. Everything seemed okay in the store, but when I got home and installed the new faucet, I had some trouble. It turns out that the included adapter isn't particularly good quality, and didn't fit the faucet threads tightly enough to stay in place once the water pressure was actually turned on.  I blew the hose nozzle off the end of the new faucet a couple of times until I finally went back to the hardware store and picked up an off the shelf adapter. Fortunately, it looks like Danby is using all standard sized parts, so I was able to replace the flaky adapter with a new one that works well for only a couple of dollars.  Once I had the thing up and running, it was easy to load and use. The basket is built to hold four full place settings, but I find that with some creative jiggering I can get it to take in any odd collection of dishes, mugs, baby cups, storage containers and what have you. The basket insert is removeable, converting it to an all glasses tray, which we found useful for party cleanup.  The machine really heats the water, so dishes come out clean. Even sticky stuff like melted cheese usually cleans right up. I've never had to use the heat boost "sanitize" setting.  It uses a very small amount of dishwasher soap and rinse fluid, and you want to be careful NOT to add too much. I made the mistake of overfilling the soap holder spilled a little too much, figured it would just rinse out, oops) and wound up flooding my countertop in suds. This has only happened once and there was no damage. Call it a learning experience.  I saw in some of the other reviews that the timer knob occasionally won't advance when you start running the machine, and this did happen to me once as well after I'd had it for about two weeks. It hasn't recurred since then, either becuase I've been particularly careful to set the timer in the right start position, or the timer's "wearing in."  Been using it steadily several times a week for a few months now, and after the initial hiccups, it's been working fine. No complaints, and now I'm looking for a Danby under counter mini refigerator to replace one in the same rec room. I'd recommend this dishwasher, provided you don't mind a little effort getting it dialed in

++  SiliconeZone Large 9 by 13 Inch Silicone Cake Pan, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This pan is nicely made, and is fairly thick silicone   but when full, it is floppy and doesn't hold its shape on the sides.  The cake I made turned out with bulges on the sides that I had to trim off to make it a nice, neat rectangle.  I understand now why some more expensive silicone pans have wire "sleds" to support the pans

They are strong, look wonderful, and put a smile on my face every time I open my cupboard at mealtime. Not one dish has chipped or cracked and the color is even and vibrant. I find the size of each item comfortable to use. The fact that they are dishwasher and microwave safe is just another wonderful bonus. Now I am looking forward to adding more pieces to my collection. Buy this set! The quality and price can't be beat!!

++  Fiesta Tangerine 20 Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love these dishes.  They are lead free and you can do so much with them because they are a solid color.

 ++  Krups FME4 14 12 Cup Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Had to turn in the first unit I bought for a replacement because a small plastic piece on the filter basket door broke, rendering the door useless.  The replacement has worked fine, but I am very careful in swinging the door open. Can't understand the nitpicking of other reviewers on the spillage when pouring from the carafe, and the forming of air bubbles in the water level tube.  Both problems are easily solved by pouring slowly enough. As to the peeling of the coating on the heating plate, I haven't had that happen either in the original unit or the replacement. I agree the instructions for setting the time on the clock and for the timer are a little complex   every time we have a power outage I have to refer to the manual to reset times.  However, the timer feature has worked without fail, unlike the Mr. Coffees I've had. I need to add that the poor visibility of the display is annoying.  Unless I'm missing something, it's backlit only when the unit is on or you're resetting times. Every coffeemaker has its pros and cons, for this one the pros far outweigh the cons. Overall, a fine machine which makes great coffee hint: if you disagree with the great coffee try one of the Caribou coffees   the combination is terrific)

 ++  Krups FME4 14 12 Cup Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless: Kitchen & Housewares ++  My wife and I selected the Krups FME 4 coffee maker to replace the Braun KF550 BK model we've used for the last 2 years.  The Braun was, and still is, an excellent machine.  But it lacked a timer, which the Krups has.  The Krups has a good clock/timer system that can be a little confusing, unless you read the manual self explanatory).  The display uses an LCD that can be difficult to view from some angles.  Overall, it works okay.  The construction of the Krups is what bothers me the most.  My Braun coffee maker has a filter holder that can stand upright on the counter while I'm filling it with grounds.  This is really useful.  Unfortunately, the filter holder for the Krups is not designed to stand on a counter, so I have to replace it in the coffee maker unit or hold it with my free hand while adding grounds.  This is a big annoyance.  Also, the review that mentions the uselessness of the water level indicator on the side of the unit is completely accurate.  Bubbles form in the indicator, making it impossible to read.  Few things bother me as much as a feature that looks great on the packaging, and that's all.  Regarding the carafe, yes, it does spill; but, only if you try to pour too fast.  I had the same problem with my Braun, and just backing off on the angle of the carafe while pouring is enough to keep the coffee in the cup.  Overall, there are some critical design flaws that really shouldn't be present in such a frequently used product; but, it makes good coffee and is fairly simple to use.  In hindsight, I might have instead bought the Braun KF580 BK, which is identical to my current model plus a clock/timer

 ++  Krups FBC1 6 Slice Digital Toaster Oven, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We're a busy family of four. This product has so many more uses than our old toaster plus it cooks fast & it's simple to use! This has been a great alternative to heating up the oven for a few pieces of cheese bread or a snack pizza. I was surprised at how evenly everything cooks. We've been very pleased with this product, in fact it has become an essential appliance. The only draw back is that it takes up more counter space however that con is overweighed by all the pros. I never thought I'd give up my old toaster, now I wish I'd done it ten years ago!

No sticking and no taste or metal reactions plus the colors are so attractive, they can be a really nice accent in your kitchen.

 ++  KitchenAid KSB5 5 Speed Blender, Majestic Yellow: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I pretty much agree with ILikeAmazon's review below.  This blender looks nice, sounds quiet and doesn't dance all over the kitchen when being used.  The lid stays put and it's easy to clean.  It also matches all my other small Kitchen Aid appliances.  Like others though, I make a smoothie every morning and I've had to learn how to use this blender for that.   First, it's helpful to let any frozen items sit for awhile in the blender I load it as soon as I get water on for my coffee so it can sit until the last thing I do before leaving the house).    If pushed for time, then I've found that putting the blender on pulse and constantly pulsing until the contents agitate on their own helps.  The problem is that either the funnel shaped bottom and/or the blades being turned in several directions pushes the frozen mush above the funnel shaped bottom of the blender.  Air enters the funnel shaped bottom and the mush calmly just sits above the blades.  At this point, the blender can be stopped and the mush gently pushed back down into the funnel before restarting the blender.    Kitchen Aid products and their customer service) are superior.  This blender is a nice addition to my kitchen.  As ILikeAmazon said:  "There are always tradeoffs."  I do hope however that they improve on the smoothie making capabilities of this powerful, attractive blender.  Then it will be a five star appliance.  By the way:  I like Amazon too!
December 28,
++  Le Creuset Enamel on Steel 2 1/5 Quart Brittany Teakettle, Flame: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I was looking for a kettle with a handle that I could pick up without using an oven mitt, and one that doesn't require removal of the whistle also with oven mitt of course) before pouring.  This kettle fit the bill.  The handle as well as the whistle are plastic and cool to the touch.  The whistle flips up with a touch of your thumb and does not require removal.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the kettle beyond the two features above which I would have thought would be standard on every kettle, but that is so not the case).  It looks nice and is sturdily constructed.  The whistle is a gentle reminder, not a screaming alarm.  It holds a lot of water, enough for about 8 cups of tea plus a little water to rinse out/pre heat the tea pot with.  My only suggestion for improvement is for the handle.  Because it's a straight bar across, it's not very ergonomic for pouring.  I often find my right wrist at a strange, almost uncomfortable angle.  I have solved the problem by using my left hand as well    first I tilt the kettle with my right hand, then I use my left hand to hold the kettle while it's pouring.  I think a curved handle would eliminate this problem

++  Trudeau Silicone Spatula   600 Degrees Fahrenheit, Blue, 9 Inch: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I am quite enamoured with this little utensil.  I bought it because it was the cheapest silicone spatula I found, but it turned out also to be the best designed.  The all silicone construction not only protects the handle from melting, and you pot from scratching, but makes it the easiest and most comfortable to use as well.  Also note that most silicone products are only rated for use up to 400F or so, while this is rated to 600F.  I havent used it at temperatures that high, but I'm comforted to know I have that option if the need arises

The Oxo is easy to grip, easy to turn the knob and I appreciate the little jaw grippy thingy on the side to help seperate the can and lid.

I would like to order some of the other accessories.

++  Farberware Cuisine 3 Quart Covered Saucepan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I like the two short handles versus the one big handle on other boilers.  This is a little less obtrusive on the stovetop that the one handle design.  It would not work well for sauces or other tasks where you need your other hand to wisk or stir.  Works great on the flat top range and cleans up nicely.  Highly recommend, but it seems to be out of stock often

 ++  Farberware Classic 12 Inch Frypan with Lid and Helper Handle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We needed to replace a 30 year old Farberware frypan. This pan was better than we expected. We are so grateful for Amazon.com!!
September 18,
++  Farberware Classic 12 Inch Frypan with Lid and Helper Handle: Kitchen & Housewares ++  Farberware classic is great    an inexpensive yet equally functional alternative to the very expensive pots & pans.  Note: recently Farberware reduced its quality, in that older Farberware pots & pans had their thick aluminum base completely encased within a stainless steel shell.  The newer pots & pans have the aluminum base attached to the bottom, but not encased within a stainless steel bottom.  So, their quality is less than it was; most people who "grew up with Farberware" may not realize this.  Farberware used to hold the patent on the technique of having the aluminum base CURVE up the side of the pan    they no longer do this, and are the same as many other manufacturers.  Also note: if you are buying a 12" pan, this is a HUGE pan, since it has a squareish cross section.  I found it to be so absolutely huge    you could fry a dozen onions in this monster    that I simply never use it.  The 10" and 8" sizes may be what you're looking for

They are a little bit stiff, and they don't seem to be softening up too much as time goes on.  I expected them to be a ton softer.  They are really good sheets, however, and I would buy them again

Just got it a month ago, not sure about the life of the machine. But I believe its Cheap and Best
November 11, 2003 ++  KitchenAid Garlic Press, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love garlic and this has been the best garlic press. I've use this almost every day for the last 6 months and it still works and looks great! It's definately worth the money
November 7, 2003 ++  KitchenAid Garlic Press, Red: Kitchen & Housewares ++  This garlic press is very well made. It's got some weight to it, but no too much. Works on the biggest cloves of garlic leaving only the skin behind. Well worth the money. Easy to clean
November 4,
 ++  Cuisinart TOB 50 Classic Toaster Oven Broiler, brushed stainless and black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We celebrated 45 years of marriage and a toaster oven has been a kitchen essential for all of those years. The Cuisinart TOB 50 is number 4. It's predecessor lasted for 24 years so it has high standards to meet and I'm optimistist. We choose it for it's simplicity, solid feel, and size hoping for reliability and ease of use. In it's early months it is meeting our expectations. It is one of the most solid and basic that I've seen on the market. The controls are solid and easy to use. It toasts evenly and you have the ability to control the darkness of the toast easily. My baking use has been limited but it does a good job of heating small portions that you don't want to microwave. The door and the hinges are solid feeling. It is a nice size without being too bulky. We store it inside a cupboard so size was an important factor. It will toast 4 slices of bread or 4 to 6 waffles depending on their size. It has a soft bell to let you know when the heating cycle is done. The crumb pan is easy to use making the unit easy to clean. The only "con" I can think of in this unit is that the shelf does not pop forward when you open the door so you need a hot pad or shelf pull to pull it forward safely
September 28,
 ++  Cuisinart TOB 50 Classic Toaster Oven Broiler, brushed stainless and black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We had had this oven for a couple months when the door would no longer stay shut.  I tried jamming a wooden spoon against it to hold it shut while cooking, but found this sort of absurd.  So I called Cuisinart for warranty service.  They said they'd replace my oven with a new one, but I had to pay to ship the oven to their warehouse in NJ and it would take a few weeks.  In the meantime my husband found a set of little magnets at our local craft store, and fixed the problem!  So I wasn't going to ship the oven to NJ   until a replacement oven arrived...before I even sent the first one out.  Hmmmm.    Anyway, we're enjoying this toaster oven very much and use it practically every day.  It is slower than a regular toaster, but cooks four pieces of toast/waffles all at once, so I figure its a fair trade.  It does a nice job with open faced sandwiches or chicken nuggets for the kids on the broiler pan, without having to heat up our full sized oven.  A practical choice especially for families with kids

++  Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick Stainless 5 1/2 Quart Saute Pan with Helper Handle and Cover: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I love this thing!  Not only does it perform beautifully, but it's absolutely gorgeous.  I prefer to serve meals in it rather than one of my pretty platters.  I waited a pretty long time almost a year) before writing my review to make sure I abused it enough.  This is my 2nd review.  Because it's well made, it's pretty heavy...that's why the "helper handle" is so helpful.    We have a chicken salad about 4 times a week so I wanted a really big pan to be able to sear my chicken all at once without having to work in shifts.    To clean and sanitize stuff, I put EVERYTHING in the dishwasher...vacuum attachments, toothbrushes, dog and cat toys etc...so the fact that this fits in my dishwasher is awesome for me.  I wash it by hand about 1/2 the time.    The nonstick coating is wonderful...not a scrape or scratch on it.  Pay particular attention to cleaning the rivets that might be the wrong terminology) that attach the handle to the pan on the inside.  The dishwasher gets all the icky stuff out of every crevice, but I use a soft dish brush for the rivets if washing by hand.  :
December 18, 2000 ++  Hoffritz 10 Inch Round Nonstick Tube Cake Pan: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I totally love this pan!  I bake cakes all the time using this and other Hoffritz pans and they are absolutely wonderful. I was first impressed by the weight of the pan, the non stick sufrace, and the even heat distribution. I noticed a remarkable difference in the quality of my cakes from the very first time I used the pan. Not only do my cakes look and taste great, I never have to worry about my cakes getting stuck to the pan or being lopsided.  I'll never buy a cheap pan again. It's really is worth the extra couple of dollars. I doubt I'll ever have to replace any of the pans I've bought from them. I also purchased the Hoffritz springform pans and 9" rounds, same great results

 ++  Toddy Maker Cold Brew Coffee Maker: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I have owned this for years and LOVE it. The directions indicate that for 1 lb of coffee, you add 5 cups of water and let it sit for hours). I actually add 9 cups of water and the coffee concentrate works just fine. I fill my ice cube trays with the coffee, then bag the cubes so that I can use it over time. It is delicious every time when you put the concentrate in a 3 to 1 ratio with water American coffee) or less for stronger coffee e.g., espresso). I particularly like to use these cubes for iced coffee    it comes out nice and strong, not watered down.  A final bonus to the toddy maker: used coffee grounds are a folk remedy for fire ants. If you have them and you want them gone without throwing a bunch of chemicals in your garden. Put these atop their nest but watch yourself!). They leave pretty quick.

++  Lodge Logic 13 1/4 Inch Pre Seasoned Skillet: Kitchen & Housewares ++  The skillet is great for for frying huge amounts of chicken cutlets when you want them all done at the same time. The quality of the cast heats evenly and stays hot as you add food into the skillet. Its much better then using teflon... Did you know if you burn teflon it kills birds, especially parrots) Well I never liked cooking in teflon and I have always loved a set of skillets that was passed down from my great grandmother all the way down to me. I am able to sear meats and gently cook scrambled eggs to perfection. Its important to realize, looking back to people that traveled the country on horse back carried a cast iron skillet and a dutch oven... Those same skillets are still in use today.. Try so to the same about your teflon or stainless steel pan from china. Just a good american made cast iron skillet and its very affordable to!!!

++  KitchenAid 8 1/2 by 10 1/2 Inch Poly Paddle Board, Black: Kitchen & Housewares ++  I'd purchased the "big brother" to this KitchenAid cutting board about a year ago, so I understand the frustration of the reviewers who complain about the apparently unremoveable label. It sounds petty until you try to scrape it off yourself.) The label DID eventually come off, but it did take a bit of muscle.  So I'm glad to say that this board arrived, a month or two ago, with no sign of a nasty Kitchenaid label at all. No more wrestling with my kitchen equipment for ME!  And, like the larger version of this cutting board, this one really is excellent. It really is non stick, even when the board is wet such as when you rinse off the tomato goop before you cut up the scallions). It cleans easily and quickly, and has no objection to the dishwasher. Plus, it looks pretty enough that I don't mind bringing it to the table, which is more than I can say for most non wood cutting boards

 ++  Sleep Right 14669 Self Warming Thermal Cat Cushion  19" X 23" Beige Leopard: Kitchen & Housewares ++  We purchased the pad for the senior cat in our house.  At 14, he is the oldest of 5   all indoors.  We put it on the bed his favorite daytime nap spot).  He loves it, but so do the other four.  They all try to squeeze in on it, with him, or take it over when he gets up.  It's never empty!  It has a bit of a "crinkly" noise but they don't seem to mind it after they try it. It seems to work great and very easy to keep clean.  The patterned side can be de furred with a few quick swipes of your hand, following the direction of the fabric nap.  Good purchase and endorsed by all 5 of our cats

It's time to retire my old butterfly pattern which I've had for decades. I rate it four stars only because it would be so much more practical to sell these in SETS OF SIX. It's more profitable for Corelle but not so practical for us. Yes the bowls are shallow and the mugs are stoneware so they are not break resistant.

Moreover, it comes with an oversized hole at the tip of the handle for easy hanging, and its easy to clean, simple construction and dishwasher safe, hardwearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years.

I got this coffee pot and I buy Dunkin Donuts coffee and grind it with the Proline Kitchenaid Grinder and it is the best coffee I have ever had.  Recently I had a kitchen remodel and the electrician showed up with his cup of coffee in hand from Dunkin Donuts.  I asked him later in the day if he wanted a cup of coffee and he was hesitant stating he did not like coffee from home coffee pots.  Well, I assured him he would love it. After having my coffee, for the rest of the week he never showed up with his own coffee, actually said, he preferred my coffee.  After the job was over, he saw my sister a few weeks later and he mentioned how he missed the coffee I made.  This is the best ever, perfect coffee every time and the perfect temperature.

Handy electronic screen shows how much longer it is until the filter needs to be washed or vacuumed. I used to wake up in the mornings because I had a stuffy nose due to all the dust where I live, and now that's gone. I would say this is a worthy investment to anyone who is looking into buying a HEPA filter, but doesn't want to go broke from the filter costs.  Its CADR Clean Air Delivery Rate) is Tobacco smoke: 145 Dust: 140 Pollen: 130  This air cleaner is suggested for use in a single closed room up to 227 square feet. I'm using it in a room that's barely 200 square feet. I can sleep with it on its high setting, but I like white noise, so some may get annoyed with it. On high, the sound is akin to a normal fan that someone would run on their desk

Pros:   The 20 oz. size makes it perfect for a college student sitting down to write a paper or read a book   or for that matter, anyone who will be seated for the next hour and needs some comfort while doing it.   The vibrant red is warming, comforting, and beautiful.     This mug is not to heavy to comfortably hold, full of liquid, with one hand.   It insulates well so that fingers aren't overheated while holding it.   Cons:   This is not related to the mug itself, but the shipping costs are monstrous.  Buy at least two if you buy one   I wish I had.  It comes in a rather oversized box
